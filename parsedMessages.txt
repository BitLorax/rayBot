Though Daisy and Gatsby both live in a world of excess, yet they still live in different worlds. While Daisy evidently lives in one of order and tradition, where brides receive lavish, feminine gifts and act as the proper housewife after marriage, Gatsby lives in a world where young single women seek to entice random men of status at parties. To Daisy, his world must seem like a vulgar rebuke to everything shes had to suffer through for the sake of propriety and family duty - domesticity, commitment to a man who doesnt even love her, etc; in other words, Gatsbys life of excess seems overly free and thus irresponsible, because to Daisy a responsible and dutiful life is one where you commit to misery.
O
It will be quick
Take it or leave it
Yes
Brian is gonna be there
Call over discord actually
You missed a call from Ray.
I'm surprised I could hear
There was so much earwax in there
Just got my ears cleaned out
Just finished
I should finish before 8 tho
Or I'll play more games.
Maybe
I'll prolly start after lunch
I'll read later today
I haven't read yet
Lmao
I thought u meant she had a zoom call
O call for dagen
Where?
What
My memory is a little spotty too lol
Rip
Iirc
Where he basically played nice until deciding to invade when someone didn't listen
Ethical diplomacy or something
Talk about his diplomacy
He kind of invaded Mexico that one time
Prolly Wilson
?
Omai
Mmm
Then somehow I connected it to psych
O shit I can write an essay starting with that
And I was like
I just had this thought about how many fake clubs and stuff there r at foothill
I didn't really think about the topics
Rip
I'll change the intro up a little and then ask Fulton to read over it
I kind of like the way mine is tho
Lmao
It is ye
Lmao
._.
Idk who Warren is
I'll think about it
Mmm
I don't wanna personally attack him or anything tho...
Obviously not
Lol
I mean, I did come up with the whole idea about clubs when one person crossed my mind...
Well it is the bay area, and everyone knows it's super cut throat here right
Hmm
Ye
Yup
They fuck over small ones
Then dropping their own costs to make it seem like they're the good guys
So by exposing how much the stuff costs when the merchants buy it
Cuz every business has to mark up the stuff they sell right
This is basically a big company trying to convince consumers that small ones r scamming them
I merged them cuz idk what the difference is supposed to be
Thesis and explain
I just merge 5he two points usually
Same thing
Economic inequality
Then talk about how the poor got poorer cuz they don't have jobs anymore
Talk about how big companies pushed out small companies
Lol
That's impact on society
Mmm
I'll be the same way I am now
It's not like I have a heavy course load next year
Vp of events ig
Sure
I could try but it'd prolly be better to have someone who's done it before, right?
I mean don't u have experience doing that
Well idk what that means
Ask them
Yes
Like abhishek or Kiran
Ask an officer of another club
Bruh
U... Didn't have a vp position?
I skimmed it
Sure
Sure
Any bs thesis works
Bruh
Laws didn't exist before the prompt either
U could prolly use it
Idk
Then talk about anti competitive strats
Or talk about how there weren't any laws against monopolies
And then say businesses exploited
Or very few
Just talk about how there weren't any laws for workers rights
Legislature stuff
Prolly something else related to business
Soooo
My family is a family of scholars and teachers
It's more a matter of principle than just being idle tho
Hmm
O
Lol
Then is mid may an arbitrary deadline u made
Don't u have to submit the form tho
Idk if I can learn that in two weeks lol
Uh
Mmm
Since doesn't look like I have anything else to do from here on...
If u want I can learn sound design
O then I've got a while
I haven't actually opened it yet lol
When is it due by
I only just saw
Wait list lmao
Ive got an I game mission going rn
Real quick
Lemme finish my mission rq
OK fine
It's not due today
Just wait till tmr
Gonna read tonight and do the thing tmr
I haven't read yet lol
?
Brian fu can't help u
Ffs will
It's a fucking smile
Will
It literally says smile
Maybe some ppl smile with the very corners of their lips turned down, idk
Yes but the author called it a smile so it's a smile
The smile
This
U dum dum
No
That's ur answer
Bruj
Bruh lmao
It means it looked like an invitation to kiss
Bruh I'm poking aadithyaa into a fit again
They said there r only a few spots left but that there r a few hundred applicants so chances r I'm fucked lmao
I feel like it went well but idk
Aight we done
Interview do be at 3 40 today
Aight bet
Lmao
Did u just submit
I'm sure she won't mind
U can turn it in a few minutes late
I've done that before too
I was about to say just cut out the header lmao
Lol
I'll try
Uh
I'll be back in prolly 20
But u decide
I still think the lemon one is a little risky
The Kiowa thing fits better imo
U should prolly just remove the lemon thing if u add in Kiowa BTW
I'll go shower rn, I'll proofread the last two when I get back after u edit it up
It's still a connection, just a contrasting one
Even if she didn't say that I think this would still be fine
U saw dagens comment for the other class right
So u can contrast the book to the soldier who questions it
He went back to the shit field to honor Kiowa, after all
Obrien seems to think friendships were important and worth it
U could contrast the book to 8t
Since she said compare
Wait
I just feel like the whole point is a little risky cuz nothing in the book directly related to it
Lmao
Kinda like natural selection too, in a way.. M
To each there own, u should be allowed to die like a thrill seeking maniac if u wanted to
She liked it there, so I thought it was fine
I mean I don't think that was really the answer
So making their relationship closer
U could try to spin it so it's about bringing her closer
Its a pretty neat question that I like
I got that line from various books and a few anime lol
I mean that sentence about love is there too
And then use song tra bong
Just change it from friendships to relationships
I mean the rat thing isn't really the same either cuz he never questions it
O lmao
Maybe I do do it
I don't consciously get rid of commas
Idk
Huh
Rip
Proofread my questions plz
Ay
It just feels bad
Idk man, there's no way to explain how wording is bad for me
And I don't work and fix it rn lol
Just really shitty wording
It's not exactly unclear
What's another year to me
I've wasted 5 already
So I take
Ab ez
Ye
Not looking to work that hard next year with Chem and bc
Ended up dropping bc for ab
Damn
We'll see ig
Physically speaking
We should be fine here with such a large Asian population tho
https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-uk/the-rise-of-coronavirus-hate-crimes
U can't say u didn't expect racism to get bad
We all saw that coming
I mean
Bruh lmao
Idr
No
Wat
Yes ty
So fuck me
Prolly gonna have - 1 1560
I'm gonna have to retake during summer
Ye my brain is too big for my skull
Cuz
Sucks to be u
Post them urself
Lmao
I post more on dagens classroom than dagen
Aight bet
I don't use gboard tho
Yes
I haven't had any bad problems
Rip
A small TV basically
My 27 inch looks nicer
But the panel itself wasn't great
34 was great for movies and stuff
Now I'm at 27
I ran 34 for a while
Nice
Nice
Damn
Ik
Rip
O
I mean yeah that seems to work out
What's support again
What support?
Ye
He's not there to check ur grammar.
Yeah he doesn't care
Lmao
At least half a dozen times
Like
He's said it
...
Wording doesn't matter
It's history essay
Also
U didn't do it directly enough I guess
Like "before they were xxx, now they can do xxx, so they're more xxx"
Compare
Major thing
Let's see
Aight
Idk if I have any dbq with me
And sometimes I put y it's significant
And what it leads to or signifies
I just write what the document or whatever entails.
Prem prolly has better idea than me
Lemme put dishes away
O
Ry8990@pleasantonusd.net
Lmao.
I just talk about it
I don't have any particular way of doing things
Idk
I might be done in like half an hour
Lol
I have an officer interview at flex tmr
Send me Pic of the section
What did u do exactly
I don't really remember
Look at the rubric
Explain y it's relevant I think
Aight
More better
More fingers
Yeet
Is it a self portrait?
Nice
Mmm
Tho I did make the switch with my mice...
I want the wireless for my desk to look nicer but don't really need it
But never did it
I've occasionally thought of buying a new rgb wireless kb
Rgb increases fps
Lmao
He be orgasming now
Brian is playing osu on my 144hz monitor and using my mech kb
Best kb
Mechanical kb
See that?
Seemed like I wasn't ever supposed to be there
Y did u add me lmao
Bruh
Bruh lmao
Tho I also partially just wanted to take a day off and de-stress a little
Called in sick to work cuz of it
Cuz stomachache lmao
I also was gone for like 20 minutes of class
It will stabilize my grade
Pretty good stuff
And he got 88/89
Then I prolly got 87/88
If this is out of 100
He picked up B+/A-
Idk who else tho
Robert
I would've had solid A otherwise
It wasn't even a good hypothetical
Idk y i did it
I made some stupid hypothetical that cost me the A
I consider dub
B+
Fulton isn't here
Welp
I just got home lmao
O fuck
Julia
Otherwise you'll just see regurgitated info from some website I thought seemed reliable
So maybe she could help
Lmao
At least she crammed theory for her exam
Well she knows theory
I don't even really know what theory means
Does this have anything to do with theory?
Hmm
Doubt *
Dihb it'll work
There's one person I could ask
Actually
None of them r
Ugh
I have a right to complain tho
Cuz it was my mistake
But I'll do it
Well it won't be good
U assumed wrong cuz I just kept forgetting about it until now
Well
Do u even know me at all
...
Especially since none of u wanted it
Should've been a sign
And u still have it to me
But even then I did say I knew nothing
I shouldn't have
I don't know any of that
U know more than I do already
Well see
U shouldn't have made it a topic in the first place Tbh cuz none of us know it
About something of which ik nothing
Make a good presentation
In any way
Possibly
I physically cannot
I can't
Music isn't the same then
...
It's not true
Must know every aspect of astrology
Someone who can see stars
It's like saying
Doesn't mean I know how to design music for games
Just because I listen to music
What
Can't learn music development when I don't know anything about music
Well I'm just gonna copy paste info from a website anyways
Wait what
Some ppl might like gaterons more
But gaterons aren't inherently bad
Mx browns r the best tactiles I think
Gotem
Just like ur existence
Just switch the key caps then lmao
They're keyboards
...
Wait what
Very good keyboards
Get a ducky keyboard
Gotem
And u like gays
I like blues
Idk
And some ppl just like it
Gaming
Lmao
What
I'm never leaving blues
Maybe u like linear switches like Brian does
U don't know unless utl tryb
That's how I decided on blues
Just go try different switches at best buy
General consensus is that they're bad
Browns r disgusting
Don't get browns
Gotem
I'll drink ur mum instead
Bruh
What is that
Just gonna eat a pear so I don't feel weird
Too much fat
Yeah
That's not it
Greasy


How do u say it in English
I'm gonna eat a pear to not feel so
Damn

I ate too much fatty meat
Sh
Like a used bandaid
Suck it up or don't do it I guess
Well then it costs $70
Search it up
Idk
Well
Mmm
"no but I'll fuck ur bitch"
His more likely response is
Let's face it will
Will look at the math one, but I'm not too keen on that
Might take bio subject test
Yup
And then some sat subject tests
Gonna clear this out then take a look at ap bio ap tests
I'm doing an officer task for debate rn
Bruh
Bruh
What is this hup hup thing
Bruh
Bruh lmao
O
But it's such a common word she won't notice
There's a word I use that isn't in my chapter lmao
Idk if ripe is in the chapter
Their souls ripe as grapes during vintage
Just change the phrase a little
Can't say
Idk, maybe?
A lot of the stuff in my poem r just individual words I put together
Lmao
U can just change the phrase tho
No, I don't think
I feel like it'd be better this way so I do it
Just kinda pops into my head
I don't really
Lmao
So dagen prolly gonna think ur writing from the perspective of small farmers and just fucked up
There's no indication about who's perspective this is from
Lmao
Like at all
But it's not shown in this poem I don't think
I guess
Rip
Pakistan sees itself as a major regional power but recent events show that Beijing considers Pakistan little more than a subordinate colony to be exploited but not heard
Lmao
My medical system so shit quarantine won't work, might as well keep them in China so they don't infect us
Every other country, including India, evacuated their citizens while this man was just like
Bruh their pm literally abandoned their citizens in wuhan
Welp, rip Pakistan lmao
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/how-china-humiliating-pakistan-126101
Not only, therefore, is Khan cowed by Chinese pressure to the point that he must turn a blind eye to the greatest repression of Muslims in the twenty-first century but he now seeks to honor the Chinese province that is at the epicenter of Chinese anti-Muslim repression.
Idk what the hell the show is but the article is nice
It's written in a pretty funny way
This article is hella funny
https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/22/i-am-not-okay-with-this-netflix-teen-drama-stranger-things
OK then
Horniness, confusion and grief combine to give a suburban teenager Carrie-like powers in Netflixs explosive teen drama
Just get an actual job then u can buy ur own clothes or something
Then I'd replace it
Unless if one of my puffy jackets gets fucked
I don't think I'll change my wardrobe anytime soon
Not clothes
Lmao.
These r socks
Might end up buying more socks with next paycheck lmao
That is the goal
I'm not gonna let this bank account fall below 400 again
Good thing I still have all my new years money saved up
There goes my paycheck tho
Very nice
So my feet don't get fucked every time
Just bought a pair of shoes and two pairs of socks for better running
I see u
Hey
Bruh
Can u do it now
Better luck next time
Lmao
Rip
When
Can u read it
My poem shit
Ay
Hmm
Just gonna read in classes tmr
Was hella tired earlier
Ima sleep now I think
Nice
Like the padding is just fucked
Cuz the two pairs I've been appropriating as running shoes r so worn through
I also need new running shoes
The ones I have r a bit worn thin
I could use new socks
Socks
Oh yeah right
I was thinking of buying something
It read like some weird maneuver to stick ur thumb up ur bum
Ye
What
Good lord
So expensive
Got my pants
Tyvm
Aight
You missed a call from Ray.
Ay
What's ur address?
I'll come
Bruh lmao
Gotem
He drilling ur mum?
What drills
Send me ur apush outline then
Dammit will
Fuck
I need wifi to do apush outline
Hmm
Do u still have power?
Rip
Cuz ur gonna become a furry artist in the future anyways
I can find a furry stash and send it tho
Nah bruh
Diy
And sell it to aadithyaa for a million
Now make it learn how to succ
V nice m
I might actually need help in bc next year, idk
Nah u give me math help
Lmao
I'll just hella carry u and get us big trophies
And fuck around
We should partner for scu2 novice
Yo next year
Lmao
I assume she put it in already
Nice
How did ur dagen grade do
Lmao
Fuck me
Gotta get to fucking Berkeley at 7 15
Ima sleep cuz debate tmr
Gl on ur decision
They both took both
Ask Kiran or Robert
U can do it in prolly 1 hour if u just skimmed or read summaries
The outline takes me around 2-3 hours because I actually read everything
I just like this textbook enough to read it all
Tho u can just not actually read it
The textbook is longer so it takes a bit to read
7 pages written.
It's like one outline every two weeks
U might want to ask someone else who'd major in engineering or something
Lmao
But I am planning to major in psych so I'm biased on that count
Cuz I genuinely really like the class
I'd say psych
Like remembering two things and using them to logic out the third
By just synthesizing some easier concepts
Some questions u can figure out without memorizing everything
I'd say 75%
Like my psych strat is identical to my apush strat
Which is exactly what I do for psych
And I usually learn new things during the test by just thinking through the answers and ruling stuff out
I mean for history I just try to understand the mindset and from there get the most likely thing
O skills
There's like maybe 2 on each test
History in terms of questions that ask u about one expirement or scientist or something.
That
K
U gotta remember specific things and how they work
It really is
I can still succeed in stem if I worked at it but ur prolly more naturally proficient at sciences
Idk, u r much more stem leaning than I am
The only class I have that's harder than bio is dagen
Obviously
Yeah
Bruh
If I took out the time I spent learning the concept while "studying" my bio study time is more like 20 minutes a chapter
Most of my bio studying is just me learning the stuff for the first time.
So u don't have to learn everything urself.
Psych she also teaches u everything
I'd fail
If I tried to wing a bio test
I'd get an A+ on every psych test
If I studied 1/5 the amount of time I did for bio
The tests r much harder
Just one outline
They get B's when they don't study
Tho Kiran and Robert get kinda clapped
Graydon does similarly
I wing every test and get A
If u want an ez class take psych
Psych is way easier
For history it'd be 2
If u meme usually 3 answers would look almost correct
Lmao.
It's a lot less clear than history
...
He doesn't teach
Read plz
Tho for me every class is a self. Learning class.
It's a self learning class
Cuz u gotta learn everything urself
Bio is like 5%
Psych is 40% historyn
Psych
Lmao
Bruh
...
I just woke up from nap
Lmao
Yes
That should do the job
Just wrote with a little arrow "ignore smudge plz"
I smudged paper
Ah fuck
U rart
That's y it's a love letter
U cut a letter in the shape of the letters
No
It was completely different from what I had on my Google doc
Yeah
First time I've ever written a love letter, I suppose
I just finished my valentines letter
And scraped it the night before the actual speech
I basically wrote a whole thing
For that speech
Wait
Lmao
Usually I just have one big thing with small revisions
This is the first time ever that I'll have multiple drafts of something prolly
Mmm
Is special
I am right now writing what is prolly the most carefully worded document I'll ever create
One Playlist fits all
I just use my general purpose Playlist for everything
U have defeated urself
Incorrect capitalization
No u
And it gives me the period
So I just end up double tapping space sometimes
And I tap really quickly and rely on autocorrect
It gives u a period.
After typing a sentence.
When u double press space on SwiftKey
Their old keyboard was good tho
Not always the most powerful tho
Apple hardware is well done
Lmao.
Download it from another Mac
Just get it free lmao.
Wait what
The os is just shitty for gaming in general
So it's whatever
But macs r inherently shit at gaming
Yes
Sweet gig
Ima prolly stick with used Microsoft laptops forever
Lmao
But there never is
So if there was ever a cheap Mac that's worth it I'd buy it too
I don't care about my laptop
Lmao
Paperwhite is so good
I don't have anything Apple in my room anymore
Lmao.
I love mine
Paperwhite is so good
Kindle paperwhite or fire?
I gotta upgrade my pc still
Lmao
Damn that's actually pretty good
Lmao
Maybe some other ppl too, idk
Robert and Justin I think.
A few other guys also applied
Bruh lmao.
3% acceptance lmao
Prolly won't make it in
Bruh
Wat
?
Everything else I put is humanities.
Psych
Lmao
Should I even turn in an app at this point
Nice
Take a sword and slice and dice
It'll protect itself and wake up if u cut it.
Just cut it.
That happens to my arm in compsci
Lmao
I got this chapter down
Let's fucking go
Only got two wrong
Speedran
Did the chapter 14 practice quiz online
So no
Never bothered learning
I ask the same for bio
Am taking a short break from bio rn
Lmao
Lmao
I remember watching him while eating dinner as a 6th grader
That was the first ytber I remember
Zexyzek or something
Might be a minecraft ytber
I don't remember
Ugh
Ima finish my apush outline tmr in psych
Lmao.

ta




*





























Nay thee
X2
Gotem
Cuz it's just like ur mum
Ur type of game then
Two days ago *
I was bored at the debate tournament
Lmao
Yesterday night I played with both Brian's
I also redownloaded clash Royale
I've been cramming on and off for ap bio today
Gotem
Ur mom
U know what else is very interesting
So ima finish tmr in classes
This chapter hella short
But I got distracted downloading visual novels
I was gonna finish the whole thing yesterday
Lmao
Gotem
Get rekt
Ur so unproductive will
Ahahaha
Does that mean I'm ahead of u
O hey I saw that
Ima go back to studying
Meth
Yex
Lif eos
Lif eos
LifeOs
It's prolly useful but I don't need it
I'm good
But otherwise I only intend to find a few quizlet
If someone asks me to help them study I'll study more
Rip
Prolly just do a quizlet in psych
Like 30 minutes or so
Ima prolly study a little for the next test
I think I read the prompt wrong or something, idk, can't remember
Cuz I got one point off on this one outline
I have 91.1
Lmao
I got 131 in total
Idk
I got minorly shafted
Lmao
Wah
Reverse Minotaur time
Lmao
Lmao
Rip
Bruh lmao
So I have to see
I need to read and study 5 chapters of bio
Lmao
Cuz I need to study bio and stuff
I have to see how much I have to do
I'll tell u tmr night
Mmm
Actually
Prolly yes
Pretty sure it's a bet
Yeah I bet u wanna get plowed
Bruh lmao
To use ublock
That's y u use Firefox
Yes
Lmao
Just get an ad blocker
Lmak
Yup
Lmao
Context &
Without any contest
Yeah perfect for that catholic priest to touch ur no no place
Just means u don't have them urges
Lmao
It's not
"if you want to get rich, just make something that will let those fool Europeans kill each other more effectively"
Something like
That quote about getting rich
So good
About the Europeans
Bruh the apush textbook quote
Mmm
That heifer lookin thicc
Willy can't relate
Imagine
Bruh imagine not wanting to fuck ur own heifer
Exactly
Kyoani
U might as well be asexual
More the sexual urges part really
Let's go
Anime trivia
Aight bet
Sounds like u
"he had little pride, no sexual urges"
Bruh lmao
So idk
Never really did anything to actively work on speaking
I can't say
But I do not want to touch it
I am strong enough to withstand the corruption
Saves me time and effort
So I just made a folder of some instead
And I don't wanna look up new ones every time
I wanna change my pfp from time to time
Furries *
I do not venture into the land of flurries
But not of flurries
Collected from my favorite shows
I have a folder of anime pfp's that is true
...
Basically
Just an anthropomorphic animal
Full fur
Yes
They might overlap but they're very different
It's like the difference between a nazi and a white supremacist
There is a distinct line between the two types of degeneracy
Furry is a different thing altogether
It's just anime
I mean that's not really furry
Ublock time
Lmao
I don't get any ads
This is great
Yes
While also thinking the civil war wasn't about slavery
They prolly believe America has the best education too
Libtard rekt
Lmao
Bill nye such a Chad
Remember the bill nye argument?
Lmao
Which would be more interesting for me
Cuz I'd rather just drop Calc and do dev psych
And Fulton too
He'd know.
O wait I'll ask my math teacher
I think ima ask Fulton tmr and maybe dagen for advice
Yeah that's what I'm kinda thinking of
I'd rather just take that period and do something like developmental psych
I'm not particularly interested in math, as you'd know
And all I really care about beyond that point is filling my math quota
I'm going into psych so Stat is actually an essential class
I mean I'll take stat
So I'd rather not have two math classes
Just that I don't think it'll be useful for me
It's not that I'm scared of the class
Should I really take Calc next year
I'm wondering
Hmm
Prolly
O yeah she said we could do that
Bruh lmao
Wait wat
?
Lmao
U absolute tard
I swear to God I've said this at least like 20 times now
Send it to my school account
How many times have I told u
Will ffs
Wait
Gimme a moment
Aight bet
What about it
Sounds like it
A Manga
No
I think I'll run at home instead today
V nice
That's cap
Did u ask someone
Bruh lmao
Graydon and I were both hella surprised
Idk how
Aadithyaa just guessed first try somehow when he guessed she was Vietnamese
I gotta be fair
U have to guess
She just met me there that one time
She's not in the class
So he guessed her first try
And apparently I looked really happy talking with her
I mean prem saw me with her walking out of Lang
Idk
I mean idk how often they're together
Ye
Mmm
She's in ur apush class
Well
Yes it's Ethan
Bruh
Bruh lmao
No
Like more specific than Asian
Which was her ethnicity
He got the hint by guessing it
Aadithyaa had one hint he had to guess
Rip
Lmao
I don't know anyone in art
It ain't
Lmao
I'm not
Before
Ye
None of those
Nop
Actually prems just seen me with her before
Idk
So did aadithyaa
Not telling u which class
Prem guessed it correctly first try
Lmao
And what some of hers r
Cuz I happen to know what some of ur classes r
Subha is a friend tho
No
No
And no
Not dagen
She's in one of ur classes
Actually
O wait
Most likely not
And no
No no no
Asmis got enough ppl chasing her as is
Y would it be Ester lmao
No and no
Bruh lmao
Same treatment for u
The debate guys only know cuz they guessed who she is
Well
The girl I like likes me back
No nono
Bruh lmao
Lmao
Bruh news doesn't come until March
What prem said
Ima clown his ww3 argument tmr
And become an entrepreneur
To learn how to innovate
U ready to get motivated
Nics
Idk how
Bruh my grade went up a bit lmao
Wait does anyone have 5th period
Fuck yeah
4.0
I did it
Amazing
Wait did she post grades
I think, idk with that GPA tho
Lmao
Play csgo against Brian
Imagine studying for apush
Lippers
It's up
I really got got
All C's on richey grammar
Lmao
I mean u could see the gap when it came to grammar
If I counted middle school then I had 8 years to catch up to
But it was still in America
I wasn't really ever taught anything in middle school either
Lmao
U don't got no excuses on language compared to me
I physically lived in China
So
I needed to catch up to 7
Hey
I don't mind it
Especially on that first essay
It's last year in particular
Lmao
I'm just saying
No I want to
In ur mum
A ton of it was improved wording
Bruh
Was my wording
Like 2/3 of it
Yes
I literally worded everything
For that first one at least
Say hi to your new Facebook friend, Ray.
Great minds think alike

That'd be interesting
I wanna see what an ai trying to mimic me would talk like
https://youtu.be/cd5QuZq5jmg
That's even weirder
She burned her whole computer onto a disk?
That's a weird thing to do
Y would she burn it onto a disk?
So I should get it back right
I'm pretty sure I turned mine in this time
Rip
I don't like the fact that I stumbled on it again
This comic has reappeared in my life
After three years
Wow
I wonder if the new episode is out
Ikr
U know the text is edited right
?
Cool
Ima see if I can do 40 for this essay
Well that's a summary of ur life. So get used to it
._.
Cuz I forgot to turn it in
Lol
She never graded my jfk either
Me neither
But not yet no
She will
Ur dud
Ye ur not did
I saw that coming
Ben ur a dud

Not unless if I get bored ig
Ain't gonna write anything today
Ye
Guess what I'm not doing today
We get the whole weekend to write this thing
Ima start late to restrict my time
It's been around 1 every time now
Make one with me
Lmao
What is this
Subject is better than receiving
Or subject
Receiving
Prem u read too much into things
Lemme find if
O I have a pov one
lmao
https://www.huzlers.com/man-dies-in-explosion-after-attempting-to-microwave-a-microwave/
Said stuff about the feminist movement in the 90s
For complex understanding I did it with doc 2
Mmm
But it happened during red scare and ww2 so I expect it'd happened before
Not sure if it actual happened
An extrapolation
Cuz if u label them unpatriotic they get fucked
I said it was used against minorities rights groups
I just went 1 and 2
That's about it
Improving my Chinese a little
I'm getting a lot better at the games I play
Working my brain is good
I don't see it
What
Seems like that's what everyone said
Delete that one folder
I demand ur time travel tech
How did u travel backwards in time to copy my answer
Prem
Am gonna apply
Azusa pacific
Violet evergarden
But have u finished what's truly important
Gimme a bit
Flat is justice, but since the earth is full of injustice, it cannot be flat
Y would I change my statement to something incorrect?
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
I'm down
O u really want an apush ap test call?
I'll prolly vc Brian during ap psych test
Ez
I can carry u and u can owe me more
Totally not in a vc with friends during ap test
Hmm? Oh discord is open for no reason, dwa8
Nothing sus here
It's just me and the Google search bar
Not group project
Tho u were supposed to do this on ur own...
I'm doing it for the same reason lol
Double whammy
Imagine being named will Liang and not having an A
If not then will will end up changing it
Do u need the grade Geoff?
Will wants an actual A instead of A- so he wants the grade
Whichever of u needs the grade more better change it a lil
Cuz it won't help u two to just turn in the same thing as me
U two better change it a little tho
Sounds good
Will knows it well
That is what I do
Just there to help if anyone needs me
I mean I won't be calling to get any ideas
What did u guys do?
Like them?
Gotem
Cuz ur bad
Read*
Mmm
30 pages to reed
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
It suffocates u
Thousands die from it every year
Super dangerous
There's this one chemical called dihydrogen oxide
Stock tanks in this game r horrendous
Tmr I have to grind a tank
Bruh lmao
Tho fun dialogue is good
That's it
I just wanna grind stuff
Idk y but I don't give a shit about anything in games lol
But outside of world building there isn't much...
If its characters pulled me more I'd prolly get myself digging around in its wikis from time to time like I do for some other series
There's a shit ton out there
U can really get lost in the world of LOTR
The world building is great
Mmm
I was kind of miffed so I implied that he had shit taste lol
The guy told me LOTR has great character dev compared to my favorite series which is literally insanely centered on its characters ._.
Ye
I liked gollum, he had an interesting internal conflict
LOTR has flat characters imo, except for gollum ig
I only care about characters when I read or watch something
Right?
Bruh I said LOTR isn't that good and some guy just assumed I hadn't read it and only watched the movies :/
Ic
What happened?
Lmao
Same
O
Who?
I wouldn't know
Ah my back hurts from sitting too much
Just a massive fucking lizard in a bottle of wine
Looked cool tbh
I've seen ones with lizards in them before
So I'd say that
U could prolly make alcohol out of cum
Everything about it is just bad
Good lord
I swear I might just end up selling this German piece of shit tank
I don't wanna bother learning ur meaning... Too much for my feeble mind
Only compared to u guys :/
Cuz usually unique means it's a needlessly complicated headache
I don't really want someone's writing to be unique
I hate playing this thing
God the tank rn I'm playing is straight garbage
Gotem
Michael zhu doesn't flow
I don't mind it
Huu
It is reality
What
I wanted to try the ap bio one
O shit I missed the practice
Gotem
For the grade ur about to get
F*
It's F0
Crash course time
Mmm
Industrial rev
Nice
...
There r also things called waifu wars
In other words it's what weebs think of as the most optimal waifu in a given show
Best is short for best girl
Sadly yes
And why
I wonder who took the time to make this
https://i.redd.it/gyxp3zfnnsw41.gif
Outside of just its wasd keys
So my keyboard is gonna get a workout
Every test I have is just gonna be writing frq's
Not like it really matters right
Idk, just use a pen if they use pens
O
Then y tf would u write
8 thought u could type it
Wait no typing?
Yes
I mean at least they pointed somewhere in the north
Lmao
Nice
When one guy pointed to like Brazil and said South Africa
._.
*that's a continent
"south America"
*Name a country
https://v.redd.it/zhlz1ayg1jw41
Check dm rq
To create a type 3 civilization
O shoot
Just write only that for ur major essay
Cuz big bucks haha
I'll figure that out later
I was thinking I should prolly change it
The ending is a little questionable ig
Mmm
?
But this is the main reason
I'm also just inherently interested
Ye
I was kind of worried it might come off as pretentious
Lol
Ye
Ties the whole essay in with what I do irl a little better
I literally stuck another paragraph in there lol
@Anaani Muss @Will Liang shared with both ur personal emails
556 words
Aight I think this is ok
Mmm
Ic
I've seen some limits say like 500
40 minutes to write and revise
Took me like 40 minutes to revise it lol
Then I jotted it down... And ended up writing the whole thing
So I just sat in bed debating to myself whether to get up and jot it down
Then I had the idea for the statement
I was gonna sleep at like 1 30
Bruh lmao
So idk if it's actually any good rn
I wrote it at like 2 30
After I check it
Ima check it later today to see
Could u read my personal statement later?
Mmm
Lmao
Imagine instead of catching fish u catch a sub with ur net
Gonna check it out tmr when I wake up to see if it's garbage or not
Exactly 420 words lmao
I just had what seemed a flash of inspiration and shat out a personal statement
Ah
Apush?

Today's?
Apparently Steinbeck used them
Ye it's American
Wat
Well then use it with spite
Gonna keep using it?
Ic
Pentel?
I tried picking up komi but just kind of forgot about it after the first volume
Rn for fate I'm reading a vn, a Ln, and a story game lol
Well actually I'm rereading wheel of time but I don't count that
Lol
I haven't been reading anything that isn't fate
Mmm
Second season is great
First season was pretty good
@ChanYoung Ben Kim r u watching the second season of kaguya?
https://v.redd.it/fjujxhhktew41
This is prolly a shit ton of caffeine too lol
Kinda sour
I put too many tea leaves
Fuck
just turn in the code?
how r we supposed to submit sos thing
wait
Smh
Should've just turned friendly fire off
Prolly
Amazing
Lmao
*During this operation, poor inter-service communication and cooperation between the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe and inexperience resulted in the loss of two German ships through friendly fire bombing and German or British mines. No Allied forces were involved.*

What
Found this in the comments
Lmao
What
Wait
And they do deserve to be fucked with if they cheat on a test
They do deserve the grade for cheating
Literally just to fuck with them and their grades
I prolly wouldn't be doing it to actually catch ppl tho
Lucky them
Lmao
I'd totally do that just to fuck with ppl
If I was a teacher
Ah fuck
Odd, right?
Apparently all the apcs hw is just copy pasting
I am proud of my own degeneracy
Yes
Gg

So both their actions and others reactions against them prove that they became the center of politics
Cuz running against trusts becane a viable platform
Basically they affected politics by now only controlling parts of it but also just by being there
Ppl organized cuz big business was focal point of politics
I had two fat ones per paragraph
Lol
I thought it was fine
I didn't mind it
Which makes it even more impressive
She let's the imagination fill in the unsaid as to just how much more there is out there
And how since she limits a huge statistic to a small part of the world
I said something about big numbers being impressive
Statistics
Ye
I don't have any code to begin with ._.
Help as in send code plz
Wait
Tic tac toe and replit
Halp
Prem
:/
American federation of labor
Bruh
What
I used integration and afl I think
Welp that was fixed
I just clicked submit without adding the doc
I almost forgot to submit again
Holy SHIT
Ye lol
Just have to quicken my pace a little and it should be perfect
Donezo

Second BP slightly sus tho
Just under an hour

Looks like I'm on time for the ap test
17 minutes
Aight finished bp1
Time to work on bp
Done with ts
Aight
Aight just did intro
Prolly something like impress and draw nature closer
I'll come up with the thesis when I get to 8t
It took like 2 minutes to figure this one out lol
Aight outlining be done
My jfk was 850
Two evidence two paragraph
I'm prolly gonna write 500 words lol
Should try to cut my time down
Only 50 minutes on ap test
One more game
Actually
If ur purpose is off u lose points
Lol
Dagen does not agree
Ima start after a game
Don't overthink it
It doesn't really matter

Ah fuck I'm getting kinda sleepy...
This episode is nice
Bruh lol
I always avoid first person, you, or your in formal ones

Unless if it's informal
Almost never
Reply to him lol
Michael wants to know what u two should do if ndf ends up being online
O @Graydon Perry
Ima start at 3 45
Aight
Gotem
Unlike ur essay
That's a little after I ate my breakfast
Look at this loser with his healthy schedule
Haven't started essay yet

That was pretty good
Done
Ah
Do what u want
My last essay was a big dick joke
I mean
I'm halfway done with lunch :)
Just like the Armenians
Gotem
Ur mum
Amen
And Moses split the red sea
I'm gonna split strat
My strat is to find two really simple things
Bruh lmao
Start at prolly 3 30
Ima eat and watch a little anime
U know what
Just wanna chill
I don't really care about getting rich
Mmm
If only it was so easy to make my eyes stop itching...
Ez
I just think about it until I stop thinking
That way u can profit without even needing to slave for law
Bruh just sell drugs while being a highschool teacher
Cuz I'm gonna need to eat soon
That's y I think I might be fucked
I might want to eat first
I'm fucked BTW
Time to start
I've finally gotten to where I wanted to in my game
Ah
Not the... Most reliable
According to their state media at least
O guys Kim Jong Un is back
Or do it while eating..
Should I start after lunch...
Mmm
Lol
I still haven't started yet
Ah
Dendrophile
Bruh in ur intro just write about how hot plants r
But I've read it
Haven't started outlining yet
Aight I just read it
There r a lot more of those than trees...
I think the average land plant is a blade of grass
Um
When is this essay due again?
Samsung smart fridge > computers
The opposite of their attitude towards u
I'm still playing my game
No
She's a fucking commie int she
My little corner of stuff
So I don't want to get 3
Tho then I can't see my little tree anymore
But I have space for 3
I use 2
Imagine not having enough space for 3 monitors
Ima play another game
Smh
Imagine not just having two monitors
Idk
I might play another game before I actually start writing
Aight essay time
It do be chill
Ye
No way
Wait so there will be either one or two frq's?
I just completed the first frq in 8 minutes and I searched every term up lol
How many frq's will we have for psych?
They said the time frame is super tight
Wait
Lmao
Big time university
The first frq
Gl
Np
I wasn't paying super close attention
Cuz it might or might not be just rozelle
If Middleton has a video watch it to make sure
Rozelle in her vid said they will put the frq into frq grades for students who need it
Did u not hear that part?
The ones after this can go into ur frq grade
Ima see if I can do the first four rn
Neat
O abhishek it seems like these finals can actually help u raise ur psych grade
I usually wake up at 10 now so I'd better readjust my sleep schedule back
Ez
But I canceled one
I was gonna have two on one day
Exact same time, four days in a row
My 4 exams r all in a row :/
O great
Wholesome family comedy that gets depressing
Kakushigoto
God why the fuck this show get so depressing
Hw is secondary
New episode for my show is out
Ah
Do as u want
Suddenlyincest

How would I know
Not me
*one of these is not like the others
I think I'll actually do this one
Mmm
Just an intro and three analysis like usual right
I'll finish apush in like 10 minutes lol
@Kiran Suresh
How long should the psych final thing take?
Then take care of apush and psych
Finish the chapter
I think ima read a bit more after dinner
Gg
...
Hopefully Brian has me covered
O
What cs?
Busy is last year or fifth grade
Just that it's more than usual
I don't think it's busy
Lol
That's more work than I've had in total for the last week
Sounds like two, three hours of work
Kind of a busy day
Mmm
This thing and dagen essay
So tmr
Wait it's just notes?
Tonight ima read my light novel a bit more
Tmr then
Aight
Night?
When is that due
I forgot about that
...
It plays the bitch card to win
It's what North Korea does to survive
In other words being a whiny bitch to win
Gotem
Nah ima just boolie u for it
I don't think I'm smart enough to realize when I can
Idk if I've ever played the pity card before
My mistake then
Ic
Mmm
So I just kinda associate the two lol
That was liberal economics way back then
Lassez Faire?
Wha
Like if it's some boomer ass it'd be funny
Depending on how they act
Like if someone was legit racist I'd think it was either funny or sad
I would feel a combo of mirth and pity
Amazing
Look at how well militants do in the middle east
What every healthy society needs
Militants
Ah yes
Lmao
I don't think I'd hate someone based off an opinion, but idk
Name ur child igneous
Feels odd
Like naming ur kid sapphire
What a weird name
Anarchy time
Gotem
Die
I like to think that there r always some ppl in every group who r good
That's always a thing as well
There can also be good ppl committing evil acts under a bad system
The answer is ez if it were hk cops
Idk if US cops r more good or more bad tho
Politically ofc
Taiwan has a great system
No
Mmm
Just like how there r always good ppl in every organization
Some r gonna be bad cuz there r always bad ppl on any given organization
Cops r a necessary evil
Bruh gMers r more oppressed
I can respect the opinion for being a opinion at least
Her stance is still a valid stance but she herself is dumb
Then that's called being a dumb fucking hypocrite
Aight there u go
And it still doesn't make her argument null
I mean as long as she knows she's spoiled that's fine
That she doesn't benefit
Did she say so somewhere else?
More that she didn't think it needed to be said
I feel like it's less that she doesn't admit it

U don't have to tag every post with "even tho I benefit from it"
Faulty comparison ig but still
Like u could say welfare is flawed while benefiting from it and not saying u do
Since when was it a requirement that u state u benefit from the system tho
That is hypocritical but it could still be true
Just cuz u benefit from something doesn't mean u can't dislike it
Still doesn't invalidate her opinion
I mean
Tho ig will is an exception
I mean just cuz someone is sheltered doesn't mean their opinion is invalid
Ig that does work
So they just printed a shit ton of money
They got the shit scared out of them because of deflation
Huh
Japan time
Imagine having almost no economic growth for 30 years
Smh
Have u not been paying attention to the news at all
A pandemic
I must be pretty powerful then
Damn
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Kiran Suresh to micro Micro.
Micro micro
Shrunk where tho
Ye
So ig they offset each other
Shreyas is a pretty alpha name
Kiran is a pretty beta name ngl
Like donuts?
Minibatches
Yes
@Kiran Suresh is second best Kiran in debate
It is how it do be
Michael = Michael
Michael Zong
Ez
Graydon can say he made toc cuz his partner has gold bid
Mmm
Inb4 gets accepted
No reach tho
Is balanced
Otherwise I have a few backups and a few targets
Ima apply to azusa University just for the name
Cuz I like it
So might as well shoot for ivy grad school
I'm gonna have to go to grad school anyways
Not just cuz I can't get in but also cuz there's no point for me doing it
I'm not applying to ivies
Or was it 3
Lol
I'm applying to like, 4 non uc schools
If I had an extra hour every day I would waste an extra hours worth of oxygen
Fuck
I mean I can't have just written it either cuz there were only 5 minutes between her comment and me putting it in
It was only 5 minutes ago
Fuck
I saw the assignment returned in notification and saw 0/50 and a private comment saying where is your rhetoric essay
I forgot to submit the jfk rhetoric essay
Oh my fucking God
Holy shit I'm a clown
When he did he started screaming, so the servant just asked him if he was a clown and said if he wanted to get on his good side he should scream in a more sophisticated way
Since it requires a ton of concentration he straight up didn't notice someone had blasted his hand off
This magus is doing a summoning ritual to summon a servant/heroic spirit to fight for him
In the book I'm reading
Lmao
I don't really remember, but there was a loophole they could exploit
Lol
So
Trusts used it to break up unions iirc
She teaches apcs now
No it's for dagen
Nice
Well
But u have to do the second one
Wait I thought it meant ur excused if u miss the first time
Tyvm
Apcs frq up
@PREMarital sex tips
Manleti
Kiran ur just intrinsically a manlet
Gives u big brain
Anime be fire
Nah
Kiran is manlet cuz he hasn't watched violet evergarden yet
I'm literally a walking piece of nostalgia...
Good times...
I would just spend the whole day going around the place with my friends
Cheap and good
The little lunches we bought were good too
Those were so fun
I remember going on school trips
Mmm
Or twice
I remember having to go to school on a weekend once
Still prolly one of the things I regret missing the most
One time they caught and threw a rat and a snake in, ofc right after I left so I missed it
They also used to burn huge piles of trash in front of the school so I would go with my friends and throw shit in
Fun times
I used to go off to fields to catch bugs and tadpoles and stuff
If I wanted to buy a chocolate bar here it'd be a 30 minute fucking walk
I miss being able to just walk somewhere I want to go to
Yup lol
So nice
The satisfaction of cooking ur own food and having it taste good
Self reliance just feels nice
There r ppl who ride subways and trains to school back in China
That's not too difficult
Mmm
So it felt pretty nice when I was home alone for a while too
I like being self reliant from time to time
I like it
Always have to figure out where to buy my food on long distance flights
Going to an airport and boarding a plane by urself, planning meals and everything
It's just got a different feel to it for some reason
I kind of miss going to airports by myself
True ig
Sanjay and arnav seem like the type that'd be interesting
We should be able to get more ppl to come as well right? For asu
Prolly not as long as I'll remember that one donkey meat place somewhere in China...
I will remember that place for a very long time
Gonna go back to that uighur place in stockton
My goal is to go to the good restaurants at every tourney we all go to
I shall watch ur career with great interest, PZ
Mmm
That's like the only thing i have
I'm like top 10-100 for most of the tanks I play out of a server of like 20k
._.
The only thing I can say I'm top 20 at is this one game I play
Lol
No wonder
We did pretty shit this year :/
Ye
Western food that I severely dislike
But in general panda express is just western food
Public forum
Like the orange chicken is just straight garbage
It's disgusting
It's so oily and some of the food is so sweet
And just poured the oil it got all over the food
It's like America invaded a middle eastern country
It's so fucking oily
It rhymes so it must be true
It has no place in this empty space
I must seal that fact from my mind
U will die and then die again in isekai land
Maybe after u die
Ur gonna die a horrible death some day
Worked out
My restaurant recommendations
Mmm
I never knew I needed rice in my life so badly until that trip in asu
It was my first time having rice in days
Or will he just see a hallway
Do u think will would see the hallway one
Bk
Everyone knows
Coconut stuff r just great in general
So good
Coconut sticky rice
If u look at it a certain way it could be a rice bowl
Great looking hallway imo
Yeah it's just a hallway
Hmm
That place was beyond fucked up
I desensitized myself a lot with enoughinternet
It'll take a lot to actually disturb me now...
I mean I don't really care about those vids
And another one sent me a vid where a puppy was trying to suckle a male dog, who started thrusting
One of my friends sent me a vid once where this little kid was just fucking a chicken
There is some fucked up stuff out there if u know where to look tho
I just use the site everyone uses
But at the time it was just
On retrospect that was some pretty funny shit
I remember seeing a clip where a woman had a whole potted plant, dirt and everything, shoved into her
That was the first time in my life I actually just turned my phone off after seeing something
Like there was this one vid where a dude murdered someone tied to a bed then ate him
The cannibalism vids were the most fucked up tho
They were something else
Like the porn clips there
There was some weird shit there man
Bro back when r/enoughinternwt was around
Just plugging at tags on nhentai
I found it funny but it'd scar some ppl
Worse, technically
Y would I need that subreddit?
A few of them were weird ig, like the desk one
At least from my perspective
Eh, the stuff I've sent haven't been that weird
U know the stuff I say too
U shouldn't be that surprised
I mean there's weirder stuff out there
Only the one time tho
I've seen it on reddit before
I've seen this all before...
But I swear I've seen this exact thing before with the same lines
Whether they were from u or from reddit I can't remember
I've seen these arguments before
I've seen this one before
Neat
So u guys do have actual projects planned outside of the id thing
What r u guys gonna work on with those grants?
Bruh lol
Sounds like a chore
Legal stuff
I'm having a hard time filling my time
So what r u guys doing now?
Still the id system?
What do u guys even work on to keep u so busy?
Nize?
Bruh
So did u not read
Wait what
Bruh
Instead of who he actually is
So it's just referring to him by an attribute
It's a nickname
Like it's not a formal address
They don't refer to him as Duke because he's a prince of somewhere
Bruh
What?
How?
So it's an attribute
Ye
Referring to him only by an attribute
Is the one where they call that one dude Duke cuz he's the prince of some place
The one for metonymy I'm using
So it was just an observation
Cuz his car did arrive
That do be kind of a stretch tho
I put the part where he says "gods truth" then starts talking as if he were lying as ironic bit that might not work
Actually, one of them might or might not work
Aight I found 3 for 4 so far @Will Liang
If I find extras I'll give them
Sry
I can't give u the quote I found cuz ima use it
I'm just gonna grab one quote each chapter and trust Kiran can find the other one
Icu
On that doc
Icu
@Will Liang
Free ideas that will get me a D where I could've gotten a C with my own garbage
So I'm spared from their garbage
At least they stopped annotating past this chapter
This isn't a fucking personal copy
Didn't even unfold the fucking pages they folded to mark where they read
Whoever had this book is a fucking idiot
Fucking marked a whole paragraph just to write $ next to it because the paragraph showed he was rich
I don't even see why they underline some of the shit
And they fucking underline and box everything
Insufferable
That's like saying if Graydon had to say he's tall them he's obviously not tall
The annotation is basically "if u have to say it it's not true"
The line where Fitzgerald says he's one of the few honest ppl he knows
They're not
Fucking troglodyte
Write down ur garbage thoughts on a book u bought urself, not one I have to suffer through
Not a personal copy
It's a fucking class copy
Annotate all over it
Did the person before me who had this book
Y the fuck
Get the names right
Stoopid
And ur both
I'm Ray
No
I'm one of those :)
Niceee
That was good
Then u got a B
Remember when u agreed with me that only a dumbass would get less than an A on that test
This is y u didn't get A on finals for bio last year
This is y ur not in bio prem
Idk y it exists but I love it
It's also my discord pfp now
Sakura fish
Fish right
O wait
I forget
What did I set mine to
Ur underage
No ur not
I like being a bludgeon
But then again
I wish I was good at persuasion
Mmm
I still need to spend 5 minutes every day copying math answers and copy pasting cs hw
Makes sense coming from my family but still...
Matter of principle ig
My mom is making me do hw cuz I'm too idle otherwise :/
Aight @Kiran Suresh 11?
Wonder where they went
Disappeared so quickly
Just like the Armenians
Speedrun
Think we could squeeze it out at 11?

Dwai
It's nothing important
Lmao
Did aadithyaa invent more clubs?
U*
Gimme officer position and I will do everything for 8
Hey prem
Ay
I'm willing to join journalism just to fuck around in dagens room for another year
Cuz first sem is college apps
Hopefully I get gov first sem
So I can only do hw during gov for one semester
I heard the econ teacher is strict
I obviously can't do it during Fulton or docmo
Fuck
Doing other hw during Calc ab?
Wait would Kelly allow that?
I assume I can't do it with Calc ab
Fuck
Wait can I use Stat to do other hw?
I can use Fulton ta period as free period ig, when I don't have work
Yeah prem ur a cool kid I get it
Next year I won't have any free periods
I'll prolly do hw :)
Mmm
My Bible
Open like
Fuck all
Exactly the same thing I did today
Ik what I did on Friday
It won't interfere with debate
Which we wouldn't
Unless if we do stuff Friday afterschool
Nope
Bet
So I should make fun of him more?
Gotem
Good thing no one cares about that then
So when we have meetings I can just stay in the room
I kinda hope I get to be 4th period ta for Fulton next year
Idk
Friday does sound nice
Hmm
Actually
My brain is experiencing atrophy
It's been this way for three and a half weeks now
If I didn't just check
I wouldn't have known today was Wednesday
Like
I honestly can't remember cuz I've lost track of the days of the week...
That's what we've been doing this year right
Keep it Wed
I'm out
Aight I've seen one too many shitty meme in prequelmemes
I just haven't seen it pop up in so long
Bee
Bruh
Fuck
OH
Oh
But good music is good music
I don't regularly listen to jazz
Prem is the superior male specimen
Will I was talking to prem
This is nice
Someone outside is playing jazz
Thx for making it for me
But thought better of it
I was thinking of making that joke
But it's the gist of it
Prolly shares only like 3 words with the actual slogan
That is extremely paraphrased
We will see direct benefits for our workers
Was roughly something like
The afl slogan or motto or spirit or whatever
The knights focused on being a political entity
Ye
Also need to exercise a little every day since otherwise I barely even walk
Fucking up my sleep schedule is fucking me up
Ugh I gotta sleep earlier
Ice cream flavor
Ye
Bruh u want it with a side of horse?
Better color pallette
Vanilla would've been better
No like
But chocolate on strawberry
Ofc it is
I decided not to send that when I saw it
It could only have been u
Smh
Who else here
Bk ofc it was u
...
Lol
I honestly have no what anyone does at the school
Mmm
And what does the asb do again
Who's running for prez?
Y vp tho?
Ima put Bernie sanders then
O shoot
https://youtu.be/oKOFPnLHu2U
I'm gonna vote for whoever has the coolest name
What
Me rn ._.
I've learned it all before so if I see a rough definition it should jog my memory
I'm just gonna search the stuff I don't know up lol
It's the only exam I think I have to study
Should I study for ap bio exam or wing it cuz open note
I should prolly check out the online ap testing thing
Ugh
Due at noon
Tmr
I'll read later today

Idk
Does that mean yes
@Kiran Suresh
O partner
Another Gatsby thing due tmr
Then same lol
O it was a book discussion?
Fuck
Wait what

Aight bet
I'd rather do that
O
A chance to lift a little debt
@Will Liang ur time has come

@Anaani Muss
Libtard rekt
There was never a problem to begin with
What problem?
Bold of u to assume you'll ever have a kid
@Will Liang can u relate?
Instead of just using the language u already know for free credits
Bruh imagine actually learning a third language
I can't read it ._.
@Brian Fu happy birthday!
Unfortunate i can't just sit for 15 hours
Otherwise I start feeling like I'm dying
I need to get up and walk around from time to time
I'm pretty sure she still thinks I'm illiterate :(
Grats man
Ig she's complimenting u for being literate
This is a Bruh moment
By looking at text u read it
How do u look at the text but not as a reader
Wait
U did well tho, right?
Totally
Sure
...
Not everyone gets them back at once
U rart
She said in batches
Flex
I got an A+ in algebra 1 but who the fuck cares about algebra 1
In classes that matter I mean
That way I can finally see an A+ on my transcript
If I just keep doing as is my psych grade will raise to an A+ anyways
I'm fine in the end
Gg
Uc's don't care about +-
Idk cuz it doesn't matter to me
Now I've barely got enough energy to go back to grinding my mobile game
But that lecture really took it out of me
I was already tired before
Cuz I've been nonstop typing for an hour and a half
God I'm fucking dying now
Which means ur joke is not funny
So that statement is factually incorrect
I was in this chat before I became a weeb
Got to the fall of the yuan lol
Then it somehow turned into an over an hour long thing where I just recount everything I know about Chinese history
I was just chatting with some guys on a discord
Welp
Walking *
@Graydon Perry r u proud of my waking speed
I was speed
I was marginally faster in walking speed than this elderly couple that popped up in front of me at some point
I was back just after my laundry finished
So just decided to go for a long walk
I haven't actually been outside for anything but laundry and garbage for like a month now lol
I got to @Kiran Suresh's neighborhood lol
That's the first time in forever I went out just for a walk

The wild west prostitutes, famed for strengthening their female bonds through frequent hoka hoka
Ah yes
Indeed
?
Aight time to take a break from incessant grinding in one game by hopping onto another game and grinding that one instead
I am curious
If we get isolated for long enough does that mean Will would end up losing his butthole and becoming a creature with a single opening
Will ic ur sense of humor has deteriorated due to extended isolation
I mute this chat when I'm grinding something
Ig ur using ios and it has some different layout
Wait this chat has a different emoji
The thumbs up is bottom right
The button that leads to the mute button is at the top of the screen
Lmao
How do u miss that badly
Um
Ig I'll go back to reading the novel I was on before
I've literally devoted two days to a single event in this game that's pretty much gonna be over by the end of the week
When this week ends im gonna look at myself and get confused about what to do next
I'm gonna go back to heating the shit out of a trap
...
I forgot about that
O there's apush stuff due

Will does not dream of joke making
Did he make that joke just to flex on me lmao
What
Still more big brain than u
Being a weeb doesn't make me rart
He's just more so
I mean he's not wrong
Will ur a rart
It's a family matter so I can only offer nonpartial input
U can fix that :)
So ur statement does not make logical sense and is thus lacking in the funnies
And most of then didn't die 50 years ago
I mean a lot of ppl from the 60s r still alive
Bruh
Your great grandfather
So how would ik
I prolly wasn't in the US
When it was popular
I mean
But never played through all of it
I have portal on my library
Well I didn't know it
The cake one?
What reference?
I must've been grinding this game for at least like 6 hours today
Time to take a break
That was three straight hours of raiding
Welp
That's a famous quote?
Get mad?
What?
Prem check dm plz
?
I'm gonna die today
So I gotta rest now before I start another session at 5
I just raided and farmed for like four to five hours nonstop
I need to rest before I get back to raiding
No
Couldn't be me
Imagine swearing in front of a teacher or on an assignment
I just saw that too
Lmao
Ry8990@pleasantonusd.net
Something like that

@Anaani Muss
O
Gotem
Gotem
Slapstick
Abhishek is capping once again
No response
Nick sucks dick
At least I have a brain
Gjgj
Lmao
That's what u were trying to say?
Bruh lmao
Wait
Its *
Yes but the reasoning behind that is inauthentic
Mine is just that since u have a good grade u don't need to be concerned about getting a better grade
Urs is more inauthentic than mine cuz ur just thinking of the grade lmao
I'm not the one who's fretting over grades lmao
U don't need anything to carry ur grade lmao
Bruh didn't u already have an A-
Pretty good ye
We all get the same score
And yes that's what we all got
Will no flex

Ggwp
Flex lmao
Ye
Bruh lmao
Ye I saw
I'm not about to waste my money just to get rejected by ivies
Bruh lmao
O
Just email ur teacher about it ig
O
What form is that?
Ap id?
I couldn't use a Hotspot if I wanted to, the connection is so shitty at my house
Rip lol
Can't relate
Imagine dcing while playing cs
Bruh lmao
Prem do u remember where urs is
Rip
My lights were flickering
Prem what's urs
Lmao
Which r just urs
I found mine and Brian
@Anaani Muss for the cs thing
They do be all flint water
Yall want some quality drinking water from flint
I was gonna farm for materials T_T
My gacha game is down for maintenance
FUCK
Tho in reality there's a very high chance I'll forget all about them by then
Ima tell myself I'll start after ap tests
Maybe I'll just look at them and use a rng to decide
Idk what to start with
Should I start with those as well?
You'll be dead by nut suffocation by then
So I'll be fine
I mean I joke but I actually only get slightly uncomfortable for an hour if I directly ingest it
I'll figure out how as I go
I will suffocate u with a coconut
Stupid fucking immune system
And my immune system decides fish r evil and will try to self destruct upon contact
I live on a fucking island where fish is a staple
Especially my fucking immune system
My whole body is honestly extremely retarded
My skin is retarded
Gotem
My mind is a no judgment zone for u cuz nothing exists to make me think lesser of u than I already do
Will I can help u with ur ps if u want
Even further beyond
This is to go

I am speed
Gotem
Inb4 they laugh at ur stupid career choice cuz they hate it too
That is a rip
Ur whole job is reading papers where teenagers try to make u feel inferior
I might work on my ps next month or something idk
Mmm
O shit i gotta do cs thing
Ps?
I can recognize rin tohsaka by her thighs 
Hentai memes never die
As r normal seasonal stuff and hentai memes
Jojo memes like this one r really common
Prolly cuz it's relatively old
I don't see many death note memes either
Cuz fucking everyone dies
That's prolly the most common aot meme
There r lots of memes about how everyone dies lol
I don't come by too many aot memes
Cuz even ur mini brain will get it
That's y I posted it
Whoops
O I already sent that one
Lmao
Lmao
Indeed
This is how it should be
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Anaani Muss to PREMarital sex tips.
PREMarital sex tips
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
Indeed
What, you've never heard of a girl with a dick?
That's what she said
I'm pretty sure at least
Should be didn't
I saw the doesn't
I see one grammar error already lol
Lmao
Gorgeous
Lmao
Nothing that matters happened
Ye
I'll just kinda bs then
Rip
O

Lol
I was just waiting for a time when I thought you'd be done with it
But then I decided to just learn everything myself and did it
And alleviate u of 1 essay worth of debt
Will I was considering asking u to just do my math quiz for me lol
And chilling is a disease
Bruh I'm scared of the cold
Hmm
Y is my food spicy today
It fosters a certain sense of contentment
The dunning Kruger effect is a powerful thing
I get that
Ignorance is bliss, especially is ur wrong
Cool ig
Lmao
U used those words urself
O wait
Go on
Prove me wrong with how many times you've called out ppl for using the words tard rart or retard since last summer
Lmao
I mean, u never hold up ur arguments over the long term, so they obviously r
Except for brief pauses where I insult u for making another meaningless argument
So I felt my mobile game was a better way to spend my time
Well I obviously can't be bothered to pay attention to ur arguments anymore since they never lead to any change anywhere
Which is obviously pretty fucking stupid
But before that point it just seemed like u not liking the word God
Yes I saw that message and I thought it made sense
Just like how u couldn't use cynical correctly before
I don't think ur using that word correctly
Y would it be naive lmao
That was the argument u started off with no?
How the word God is used to praise aptitude
That seemed to be the largest thing ur argument was on
It does unless if I missed something
What did I do that strawmanned u
I don't think I did any strawmanning but I did do the second part
Lmao
All you've been arguing this whole time was how u subjectively think the word God isn't good as a compliment
Finally some sense
I like flaming and insulting ppl who have big egos, that's about it :)
This is a personal attack
The game I'm playing just said to not spend all ur time online ._.
At least today's aadithyaa, cuz next week's aadithyaa won't give a shit or remember anymore
Unless if ur aadithyaa, ig
I mean it's pretty fucking easy to tell what the intentions of someone calling u a God is
The words meaning entirely hinges on how u interpret it, and u obviously just interpret it in a way that's convenient for u to make this shitty argument
Depending on how u interpret it, it'll be talking about a shitty measurement system or actual feet
Take the sentence "Americans like feet"
A words meaning is how it's interpreted
I feel the need to do so, just as u feel the need to make pointless arguments
What else is the literal definition of God
Lmao
That they're a deity u rart
So regardless u can only argue through ur own interpretation
And the meaning of a word always depends on context and interpretation
So it's only the definition u urself tag onto it that matters
Cuz the literal definition is obviously not applicable here
Then what does it hinge on
Ur entire argument hinges on how u interpret the word God as being bad
Lmao
Doesn't that just nullify ur whole argument cuz ur only arguing by how u urself interpret the word
Lmao
That's y I didn't use old lol
Did u just stumble on new subreddits or something?
This week was also the first time I saw u start making prequel jokes
Y r u just now using these aged memes?
Damn gotem
Bruh that's offensive
Prude prune same thing
U can still act like a prune when ur calm
Downloose?
Cuz u get so uptight all the time
It's funny
I had a gif that responded to that on some discord but idk where it went
U did not ask me
Nope
I don't think most things that you've engaged in this chat are called thoughtful discussions lol
I don't feel like engaging in a discussion that doesn't mean anything when I could instead grind for meaningless digital currencies
I don't think anyone would see a normal compliment as important unless if they were looking for something
Mmm
Like stepping on my charger, losing a sock, or dealing with u
But I am offended by things that make me uncomfortable or tired
Not the same way u r
I am
But
I guess it isn't quite connotation

I would know cuz I do that all the time
It just feels like ur looking for something to complain about
Cuz incessant complaining about something that doesn't matter sure sounds like being offended
Or maybe it's just how I'm reading it
Words and phrases have this thing called connotation, I believe we learned that in English
By sounding like something, obviously
U sure sound the part
Ur just trying too hard to find something to be offended about
Calling someone a pro isn't anywhere near saying they got where they did without effort lmao
Bump
Like if u fail a test u blame ur genes or some shit instead of urself and think u can't solve it
External locus of control is just thinking ur life is controlled by something that isn't u
It's just u interpreting it that way
But that's not how it works
It is
No it's called praising someone for being good lol
Vocab word ooo
Just an observation
Not an attack or anything
Aadithyaa u seem to misread ppl a lot lol
Libtard rekt
Will is older than 10
This year should just be canceled
Rip
Totally not problematic
Flat is Justice set your nickname to .
Mine is fine
Yup
JUSTINside ur mum
No
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Junyoung Jeong to JUSTINside a five year old.
If he wants the legal one he can ask for it
I'm just gonna give him the illegal one for now
Do u want the legal one or the illegal one
I've got two
Actually
I was gonna make it something else but this seems more appropriate
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Junyoung Jeong to JUSTINside jail.
Lemme think of one for u
Aight
"even God cannot hold a candle to my brilliance, I'm simply the best, 100/10"
Tf
We want to provide an update regarding AP refunds for those of you planning on canceling your AP exam.  We were recently informed that College Board has locked the portal that allows coordinators to change a students exam status
Complex understanding is still there
Two pieces of outside info
It's even easier now
Lmao
4 docs
O yeah I'm looking at the rubric
Wait did they change the dbq to only need 3 docs or something?
We're basically writing a small dbq this Friday :/
Y is lipman suddenly putting so much stuff on us
Welp I kinda bsed that but it should work
Lmao
O his name is nick?
What's the name of the Narrator/Mc?
Aight bet
hope this doesnt take long
aight time to start the rhetorical analysis thing
https://youtu.be/y8JtxVGvyOY
I don't remember anymore
...
O wait no it was at like 6
Fuck
I thought I woke up from a nap at like 5 30
Did I just fall asleep again
It's 7
The fuck
Rejoice
The curse has been broken
Y am I trying so hard to avoid reading gatsby
And then just pull something from modern politics or economics or whatever as the other
So u only need one thing per time period as relevant outside info
Just use info from like rn
Wait that's even easier then
Can outside info also be complex understanding? I forgetb
And then u should be covered
Just do like 2 things a chapter
Then copy paste that onto ur dbq during ap test
Y don't u just go through ur old study guides and copy paste some useful info onto a doc
Will made study guides right
Wait
What r u doing to study for apush @Anaani Muss ?
Idk y
Epic Bible College has a pretty low graduation rate lol
Smh
That's discrimination against the disabled aadithyaa
I can't do that if I was born that way
My original question was just what's there to study for cuz dbq
That's not my point :/
There's nothing to study for
And ur set for a dbq
U just need to know like one or two pieces of generic info that everyone knows
Exactly
Just do something like that
Like for the dbq thing lipman just assigned us I spun the industrial revolution to relate to slavery and the Missouri compromise
Doesn't have to even be relevant to the topic if u can just spin it in a way that makes it relevant
But all u really need is like one or two pieces of info related to a time period
Well ig u would have to study if u couldn't memorize enough outside inf9
And outside info
Context u can just search it up
I mean
But the dbq gives u all the info u need
For an leq I'd get it
No I just don't understand how u would study for a dbq
How would u even study for that?
U guys r studying for that?
The dbq ap test?
Apush?
What r yall talking about?
Omai
Super waste time
Then scan it into pdf
Print out the content outline
Big brain move
O ic
What's ee stuff?
I can't read the texts above and scroll if ppl send new texts
Oh my God this app is so shit
Can't relate
Imagine going into an impacted major
Go work at Starbucks and drop nothing aside from ur coffee and pride
Smh
U should've paid attention
Next year
What's this?
Maybe monogatari
Idk what yet
Next time I go back to China I might buy a hard copy of some series
But I think ima read the fate novels first
I've got a few Manga on my to read list
Omai
Tho I want to balance that with some grinding
That gives me enough time to read Gatsby
So ig not
But I'm tired
I was gonna run today
Imagine doing them
Thx
What the fuck even is Baylor university
I've been getting so many fucking "virtual tour" emails
I just went through and blocked every college I found in my inbox today lol
I'm not young enough for u
Flat is Justice set the nickname for ChanYoung Ben Kim to Shotacon.
Age is just a number
Cuz I've been keeping tags on servants and trying to plan out what to do
It's mostly filled with fgo stuff now
My search history is surprisingly clean
Yes
Don't need it
Will search up flat is justice
Bruh
I like the characters but ik I prolly couldn't stand them irl lmao
Bruh
Azusa Nakano
Search it up
That is the only reason
I like her character a lot
This one
Azusa is one of the girls in k on
Too good to not do it
The name
Ray set her own nickname to Flat is Justice.
Cuz of that name
They also have a college of the same name that ima apply to
What a name for a city
Azusa
Ima need to make a pilgrimage to this one city in LA county someday
Cold plus slippery
Will's name is perfect
It doesn't make any sense to me
I don't like that subreddit
I saw it on another subreddit
Bruh lmao
That was tagged onto the sentence before it
No that wasn't a question
Who needs to start reading the great Gatsby soon
The herald of a new generation of lifeforms
I'm a brand new creation with no root within the old and inferior human race
Yep
Will just happened to only get the bad parts
Every good person has bad parts to them
That's easier
Or u could just insult his genes
A joke-ception
A revolution that was poorly executed where a lot of poor ppl were executed
If I had to assume everything that was poorly executed as a joke then I'd have to laugh at the French revolution
Mmm
Heuristic
Cuz I clowned u for it and u got a little defensive
Nah
And u paused before asking me what was Constantinople again
I asked u y is Constantinople important
There was this one time when u had me help u study for apwh
This is the man who forgot what Constantinople was
But he's will so I can't be sure
I think he's joking
Me next year in ap Chem after forgetting to study Chem over the summer
Clownery time

So polarize an object?
My small stem brain is still bigger than Will's physics capabilities
Lmao
U have one charged thing induce a charge in the other without direct contact
Just polarizing the object
But that's not really transferring anything
Maybe that's something like what he meant?
Iirc
I mean u can polarize an object using a magnet right
Since they're all already in the object
How do u transfer anything within an object?
Nice
Electrons don't need direct contact
So I remembered correctly
I'm spending most of my time grinding a Japanese gacha game now
Like an hour or two a day prolly
Rn I'm not watching that much tho
Anime can be seen as nerdy
Making coding jokes also makes u a nerd
Nah that makes u an art nerd
Same difference
U don't get much more nerdy than that
U procrastinate by coding
Will u r extremely nerdy
Electrons don't need direct contact to transfer right?
Not really
Amazing show
Hbo's Rome
I like Rome more tho
It was pretty good
I watched season 1 of that a while back
O
So there is no interference
And I usually watch stuff while eating
Eating is biologically necessary
That is false
But u could just not
U should do it
Get saved
Ez
Just don't do it if u don't want to
Disgusting
And a fucking weeb too
Cuz it's so ironic coming from u
But I'm still gonna clown u for it
Yes ur obviously kidding
Ur one to talk
He's just asking for questions tho
I forgot to read Gatsby tho
I just wanted to get it all over with
It is

I self graded without it
Understandable
It's some horrifying shit in fate zero
Good for u
Alright ig u don't know
Worms?
U can find enough of that in fate zero
Bruh
Sakura fish
Has my pfp updated
y do it not be on spotify :(
this too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Od7QCsyqkE
there u go
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Anaani Muss to PREMonition of the Cum Zone.
I guess he doesn't want to be royalty
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Anaani Muss to heir to the cum throne.
heir of the cum throne
i fucking love this video
o now it works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxcj8dtgxIU
well ig im just not good enough
lmao
this doesnt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhUMy_GMgUg
That is what's called a bad idea
Y would u ever look at anything I send with a pusd account
Lmao
Y would u open it with ur pusd account
It's in ur history now lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxcj8dtgxIU
So y bother changing ur routine
Cuz it doesn't really matter either way
More just a force of habit
I doubt they're pretending like it's not a thing
Cuz they r optional whether he wants them to be or not
It doesn't matter if he makes them optional or not
Cuz our grades won't dip below q3
And it is optional for us
Well then ask him to do it
I mean it is helpful for some ppl
Which is what I'm looking forwards to
And he's prolly gonna clown me about it
So this is my indirect way of telling him I'm not doing them
He messaged me about the first one and it'd be too rude to outright tell him I don't intend to do any of them
Lmao
U did the same thing?
Bruh
I just deleted those sections of the instructions
U see how it tells u to do the concept outline with a video and to use ur concept outline as a reference
I wonder how he's gonna react
For day 2 I went on my copy of the doc and deleted every mention of the concept outline
Ain't gonna go back and do it
Well I'm done
I ended up just grading myself without the ppt and bsed it lmao
So I couldn't open it with my school account lmao
He linked a ppt that's needed for the assignment but didnt share it
For lipmans day 3 thing

Just don't think about it
Apush these r meant to be shat out in 5 seconds

O for apush
Thesis?
Not filling out any of those damned charts anymore
Except for the stupid chart
Ima do all the apush unit 4 stuff today tho
Aight then my plan is fine
Wait when is it due tmr?
Ima read today and do it tmr
Mmhm
So he can get away from his impending doom
Procrastination
1 gang
O
U could just not do it ._.
Art?
What's that?
I can use their Saber or tamamo or Nero :)

I mean if I can upgrade his np that's great
But I managed to catch a few whales so I'll be fine regardless
So I prolly used up all my luck
I got one of the best servants lmao
I did
I can feel it
I'm gonna get fucked by rng next time I roll
Fucking gacha
Fgo
Perverted loli on piece of shit
Now he's fucking dead
I'm gonna pop a fucking noble phantasm on this shit head
R u fucking serious
Omfg I left this cunt on 1 hp
Bruh lmao
Y bother to name it when I can just describe it
So u need to describe it
Like at the start of the year
She specifically said some teachers teach some words differently so if u only name the device it's gonna be bad
No it won't lmao
Where?
Knowing them by name isn't gonna be useful anywhere lol
Review for what?
Bruh r yall gonna try to memorize the rhetorical devices for the ap test
I'm not gonna bother remembering all the devices when I can just describe them and get the point across
U only need to describe it
U don't even have to say the specific term ffs
And let me play my stupid gacha
Just go write ur damn analysis
Who gives a shit
Bruh we all use these words interchangeably most of the time

So it's true but doesn't seem like it is
That's a paradox.
a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.
So it's a paradox
It's true
It is
That do be the definition
Ye
A truth that at face value seems like it's contradictory
Paradox has to be a truth
O nvm
Juxtaposition I think it was?
I should prolly read some today
O Gatsby
What?
Who?
Ggwp
Bruh lmao
Didn't u just get added back?
Wait y didn't u ask me when I dmed u earlier lmao
Welp gg
Lmao
When u typed that and left I was thinking u should prolly dm someone
O I forgot lmao
That was literally the same time as when I woke up
O the lipman zoom thing was early
That was good ed
This quarantine is gonna kill my wallet
I just need a lot of fucking grinding tho...
So some nice words could help
And it's not a good time rn for a lot of ppl
Words of encouragement r always nice
Prolly just to make u feel better
It's not like it changes anything for us if he doesn't read it so y fake it
I doubt that's what he's trying to do lol
I mean I would do the same lmao
I'm gonna pretend as if I didn't know about it
Ugh
I did not know the apush thing due today had two parts
Um
Complications
Oh shit
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-politics-idUSKBN223011
It's two branches r gonna smoosh up against my window eventually
My little desk tree is starting to get a bit big lol
Well I hope ur plant doesn't die
Bruh lmao
If u just throw the dirt and shit away
Replace the dirt?
It was a while back when I looked into desk plants
Cant remember if root rot was a thing for them or not
And iirc succulents don't like too much water
There's such a thing as too much water
U sure the plant won't be hurt?
Lmao
Did u just flood ur desk plant
That question does not dignify a response
Omai
It's not something I expected to see just out in the open so I didn't realize what it was lmao
I didn't even realize they were dildos until I took one and looked at it
And a lot of them had those dildos
The street was lined with little shops
It was one of the tourist islands
Just a normal shop
That was a surprise
I just remember seeing Greek shops with racks of wooden dildos
Lmao
It gets even worse when u look at the shit some of them draw
Scary shit
They're fucking freaky man
If it comes to strange fetishes and shit Japan has got u
But Japan is the weirdest
Germany is weird
Respect for that
The Swedish have some kinky shit going on tho
Norse mythology is some good shit
Scandinavian man
Graydon lives in ikea
Smh
But just imagine not knowing where Graydon lives
Dwai
I'm not gonna send ur info out lmao
Can't relate
Imagine not knowing where Graydon lives
What's horse?
Does prem not know how to mute a group
Sounds interesting
I want to watch that vid now
Fuck
I have no memory of that
I was prolly doing hw lmao
What
The plot thickens...
A clit is technically just an underdeveloped dick iirc
Hmm
So ur saying aadithyaa has a clit instead of a dick
Hold on
Wait that's just a clit isn't it
Then ur prolly gonna get killed for being a demonic incarnation
Unless if ur born in the middle east or rural India or something
Make money in a freak show or sell them after removal
So dick nipples r the way to go it seems
And then sell them for massive profits
Surgery
U could make hella money off dick sized nipples in a freak show or something
Cuz I don't think the other one exists as a tag
So that should be ur answer
Dick nipples is a tag
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Aadithyaa Sridharbaskari to Z Score.
Good shit
Arthur was a woman and merlin gave her a dick to produce an heir
I love fate
This is cannon in the fate universe btw
Hence dick wizard
Backup
Give the king a dick if a girl pulled the sword out
Change my mind
Kings should be decided by a sword and a dick wizard

I did not lose that one
Nice
Aight I checked and I still have it
O that one
Shirtless pic of who
No ur just edgy
Does that mean u have an older sibling?
God I love making shitty jokes
Gotem
Just like the condom ur dad used
I have a certain tolerance for shota/lolicons
If he's into weird shit that's fine tho
But not an sao fan
I wanna get a weeb roommate
That what I usually do
I have a feeling I'll just form a small group of friends
Me except I just won't know who they r
Starbucks major gang
Bad*
That's not had
So I just remembered outdated info
O ic
O wot
My memory do be shuffling itself randomly
Then who was the bio person
Ah
He's taking compsci this year
Can't quite remember rn
Bioengineering or something
Or was it bio
Abhishek r u going for polisci?
Mmm
I mean abhishek skipped a year of math
I just signed up for psych courses that seemed interesting lol
Sure then
Take whatever class u want
If u already learned multi then y take it
Ty
But otherwise I'm fine
I have to mail my stuff in
Oh fuck I might have lost it
Fuck do I not have it in Google photos anymore
Lemme try and find it
That picture is buried so deep
I remember now
O shit that one
I don't usually use pics of myself for anything
I never had a Pic of myself as a pfp that I can remember
Old pfp?
I was wrong
Ah ic
It just occurred to me that prolly no one has. A picture of me by myself
Hmm
This list is cap
When the fuck does tanjiro simp
And that's with me avoiding like a third or more of the wiki for spoiler reasons
There's so much shit that I never get tried of binging the wiki
I was going into fate lore again
Not unlike my position on the fbi watchlist
Indeed
My nickname is my new religion
It is glorious down here
Diving deeper into degeneracy
I am taking step after step
It's my anime count
Gotem
My higher ethnicity
My superior country
My bigger brain
Bruh quit spamming
Quit spamming
R u discriminating against my religion prem?
It's a religion
It's thighology
No it's not
This is gonna be my religion for now
There u go
Ray set her own nickname to Thighology.
Ima change my religion real quick
Wait
I am the counter culture
I choose not to
Can't relate
Haha
Imagine accomplishing something
Abolish private property
Hippity hoppity

Ur joke not funny
Ye
That makes no sense bruh
So will is incorrect in that case
So will cs tho
Physics prolly won't ever die lol
?
What an answer
It'll end up where it does
That yeah
Cuz no one can
Get fucked
Neither of u can
That's right
Go and predict where a rubber ball will land after it goes down a river with tons of overlapping currents
Still a non sequitur argument
Not next year
That's this year
As bad as I am at spelling
Ur bad
Prem this is both ad hominen and non sequitor
Just cuz I have it doesn't disprove the point that u could next year
I did not succumb, I chose to embody it
And other hilarious jokes u tell urself
Namely math
I prolly will
But for other classes
Not for Fulton
I will
Fs
Coding is more productive than watching anime for me
Ah yes fs
I canceled the ap test lmao
Y would I
Everyone ignored me when I asked :/
I didn't know when the hell it was due by
All the assignments r gonna be rhetorical style stuff ._.
I mean u could just ignore it
Mmhm
Y u asking?
Nop
I just realized I can clean my bag out now cuz we're not gonna go back to school this year lmao
Damn really?
So has my rca cable but that thing is fucking defective it seems
My figurine has arrived
Ah
https://youtu.be/timvZTKr5HQ
And now I'm back on season 2
Strange
But then y didn't the bdrip I used to watch from have it
So ig it's a blu-ray special
The episode wasn't on any streaming service either
This is a different download than the one I used to watch on
K on
Y wasn't this episode anywhere else
Tf
Yet I've never seen the episode I just watched
I've watched this same show 8 times.

Bruh lmao
Since bullets r better at killing people than soap, it must work the same way with viruses
If soap can kill the virus then guns can do it better
Lmao
How fucking brain dead do u have to be to think this is a good idea in any capacity
These redneck dumb fucks
Just look at that fucking picture
https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/16/armed-protesters-demand-an-end-to-michigans-coronavirus-lockdown-orders-video
They're actually holding a fucking protest against the quarentine
Throw them in a fucking concentration camp
Why can't we have that now
Because they'd be the assholes the tribe kills or lets die
Ppl who can't think about the safety of others used to get selected out of the gene pool
Why can't these ppl just die from the coronavirus :/
What the fuck
It's a religious thing
Oh no
I'm pretty sure that's how it works
They don't change based on any input unless if ur teacher specifically went to change ur mark
Regardless of when q3 ends
The marks don't change at all
And a 3rd quarter
There's a 3rd quarter progress
Were u looking at the right 3rd quarter
No mine r all the same
?
Who told u that?
Does no one know?
Bump
Lmao
Cuz he was just so annoyed by all the late emails
Everything due at midnight now
11 59
Ye
Rekt
I can't remember anymore
Was it a Tuesday or Wednesday?
Actually nvm I think I was driving that day
Wait
I was biking tho ._.
Ye lmao
Could u have gotten excused from tardy quiz
Wait if u just skipped lipman that one day
Yup
I can't relate
@Kiran Suresh can u imagine being tardy to ur first period like will?
I didn't attempt any ec whatsoever
Idk how would ik
I'll have to tell my mom first to see if she's fine with me not doing hw
Maybe never...
Ec?
Been busy savescumming fgo
Am confused
So is there a confirmed result?
Heh
#cancellife
Bruh life is stressful
But it doesn't go into GPA :/
Bruh
That's actual garbage tf
So #3?
It's like 1 and 2 had a child and the child was stillborn
Yup
So it's 1 but garbage
So it's 1 without any of the reason for 1 being good
It's 1 but it doesn't count towards gpa
1 is good, 3 is bad
#3 garbage
Gg
Garbage
Bruh but I'd have to put in work
The more effort the worse it is
I'd have to put in work for that
That's shitty
I don't want that
If everyone was rewarded for working hard then Harvard should accept more ppl
Lmao
Proofreading
Will just kinda takes a peak and dips
Cuz u catch my retarded fragments
U r most useful proofreader
I'll use that
That sounds like a you problem
I ain't doing shit for that class anymore
No more gay ass fucking math hw for me tho
I'll just be a little more fine with #1
In every world I'll be fine
Haven't thought anything about grades until today lmao
#1 is still good for me but I don't really care which one passes

So u can fix ur grade by acing it
If he's anything like rozelle u could prolly ask him to do an frq
Just ask Middleton to round u up or give an frq or something

Well then yeah ur fucked cuz no frq left
I mean if u fucked up ur tests that bad q3 I'd doubt you'd do a magical recovery q4
What percentage was ur test average?
Cuz we're not getting any frq
If it was frq as well then ur fucked
If it was only tests
30 points is enough to pull u up to an A
Wait
And from there I just keep pulling up
I usually fuck up at the start of q1
Bruh lmao
If u fucked up quarter 3 bad enough that that isn't enough then how can u guarantee that u wouldn't have just fucked up q4 the same way :/
Not much but it's a little
Each unit is 15 points of tests
Psych grades can only ever go up from now tho
Such is the way of capitalism
I just want #1 cuz it puts me at a personal advantage :)
Ah shii
Cuz every 100% quiz in math brings my test average down
My math grade can only go down lmao
We do?
So dagen grades can still be raised as normal
Same for assignments
Wait Bruh our essays r worth the same points lmao
Well I mean if u fucked up q3 that's ur own fault
What
U can still raise ur grade :/
That's exactly y I want it lol
I've been taking about #1 the whole time lol
Cuz then no one gets put at any disadvantage
Which is the whole point of me not wanting it
Obviously not with pass fail
It's not guaranteed to raise it
Ur GPA can still go down from q3 grades lol

If all else is the same

I'm just explaining my very selfish reasoning for wanting #1
It's about putting others who aren't me at a disadvantage :)
It's not about me being at disadvantage
So if I only got one B q3 and someone got two B's I can shaft them with slightly higher gpa
Then I'll have a small advantage if #1 goes through cuz I might end up having better q3
No I'm talking about #1
?
They can still put u up against ppl from ur own school tho
So I want #1
And #1 gives me the best advantage
I don't really care if GPA is a thing or not, only whether or not I get a personal advantage
Cuz that means i get an advantage
But still, my quarter 3 GPA is high so I want that option personally
World *
O I guess I'll have no work on either work
#2
Wait what did I just say
Pass fail is #3 isn't it?
That's option 1
Wait Def yes
Which is an L
I have to do more work
If it's pass fail
And besides
Then that's amazing
If ur 3rd quarter grades only go up
Cuz then no easily inflated gpa
I want letter grades
Bruh fuck u
Imagine losing to someone with anime stickers on his lap to and phone
Gg
Lmao
Get fucked I guess
I hope we can
?
I can't just stop doing math hw
Actual garbage tier
That means I still have to do some work
That's so shitty
Fuck
Like is it still a % grade that determines if u pass or fail
Does anyone know what exactly pass or fail entails?
@Will Liang?
I'll just send the docs to u if u can
Aight
Pl0x
I'll just give u postage $ next time we meet
If u haven't yet could u do me a favor and mail mines too
@Will Liang @ChanYoung Ben Kim when r u guys mailing ur laspo thing?
I'll get a C anyways lol
But it should be fine
This essay is a little wonk
850 words
Aight am done
Y hang a cucumber off the ceiling
By preempting Ben he's doing what rubber failed to do
Gotem
If ppl could ctrl z out of something as major as that then u wouldn't exist
Now I just need to do bp2 and I'm done
Finished bp1
Ig this will be quick break from essay
O shit I should do my laundry
Mine is a dick joke
So idk
My intro didn't talk about Kennedy at all
Lmao
Idk I don't go to dagen flex often enough
Abhishek u should prolly change ur nickname lol
The guy apparently sold hella drugs
Prolly a drug deal gone wrong or something
Stabbed to death
Fight at hotel parking lot
I think so
I don't know who he is Tbh
Yup
6 digits?

Jfk is bent on keeping America's stick the biggest, and now he has the whole nation behind him
Mine was a dick joke :)
Especially not in that one shady looking neighborhood
Oakland ain't got no crime
Wasn't scary at all
So safe
I walked alone at Stockton this one time
True
Last one was 8 years Go apparently
Apparently his brother said it on Instagram
The identity isn't released on the official article
That's what Brian told me
Holy fuck
That was bad timing prem
AJ
Someone from our school got stabbed to death
Dude
Bruh lmao
Hmm
I changed by American exceptionalism thing to American dream
Lol
I don't remember any specific affects so I won't use any
O
Guilt tripping?
I'm using it a different way tho
Is a good quote
Icic
Cuz he's basically saying ur failing ur ancestors if u don't do this
Also the those who came before us quote
But it do be looking that way rn
I'll tell u when I finish
Mine is prolly 2 pages double Spaced lil
Watching anime rn
I'm taking a lunch break
Will that's kinda gay
amazing
my intro is a dick joke and so is my conclusion
i love this
lmao
concluding sentence
JFK is set on keeping Americas stick the biggest, and now he has the whole nation behind him.
ez outro time
Ultimately, JFK effectively conveys an urgent need for NASA through references to American exceptionalism and the evils of Communism.
gg
i can write the outro rn lol
now i just need to format quotes and figure out analysis
mmm
ima eat lunch and take a break
should take prolly 30 minutes to finish up the bp's
i already have the quotes and short analysis
this should work out well
ts2
By hinting at Soviet opposition and competition, JFK draws upon Americas hatred for Communism to create a sense of urgent necessity for the creation of NASA.
Bruh
Ts1
Works?
Jfk's allusions to American exceptionalism discredits and opposition and fosters a sense of nationalism to urge support for nasa
Spare me
I'm hungry and tired
I got confused lol
O wait
The effect is to gather support
That's my thesis lmao
Thus, in his speech to advertise nasa, jfk draws upon both American exceptional ism and America's distaste for the ussr to garner popular support
My thesis is a lot more mild tho
Compensating for my big brain
And how they couldn't accept the soviets having a potentially bigger stick
Then I said having the biggest stick was an American tradition
I started off talking about big stick diplomacy
Lmao
I said stick instead of dick
My intro is basically about the US and ussr comparing sizes
Lmao
Let's go
My intro is a thinly veiled dick joke
Aight now it's 2x2
I'm just writing intro rn
I'll have to choose tho since 2 of them say the same thing in each bp
I can but idk which quotes to give up
This should be fine
6 quotes, 3 per bp
Heh
No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come
Hopefully I'm right
I wrote down purpose method and audience before reading
Lemme read first
?
Lol
So I basically just wrote the essay in 20 minutes
I did all 3 days
I just finished all the apush dbq stuff lol
Ugh
So it's a full essay right
I've been working on the apush dbq lol
Wot
Fuck
Um
Wait so what's happening
What?
Easier to spit out one shit essay than to work on it over a few days
I think I'll just do it all today later
Tyvm
O icic
I just see the concept outline
I don't see it there
The unit 3 review 2020 doc?
Where is the unit 3 dbq we're supposed to download?
Nice
Lmao
Since I just ate breakfast like twenty minutes ago
Today it'll be at 3 or so I think
That's gonna be right before lunch
Gdi
Ugh
Like the practice essay for today
When do yall think she's gonna put the essays up?
In every world
Well ig this means I don't have to do math hw if I don't want to
Just that there is a letter grade but it doesn't matter?
What exactly is option 3?
Option 1 looks good to me
God I slept too much and now I feel like shit
But my evidence and analysis hard carried me
Apparently my connections to the argument were fuzzy all the way through
I randomly capitalized a word
Lmao
That's kinda
I didn't say anything about a truism so I lost a little for that
Huh
That's not bad
Highest grade I've gotten on an essay so far

@Will Liang @Anaani Muss did u do well on the essay?
Holy fuck I had so many notifications
Neat
The stuff I ordered gets here Saturday
Mmm
Oh fuck I just woke up
That happens only 1/3 of the time now
Hopefully I don't wake up like a zombie
Gonna see if I could squeeze in a run tmr
I'm gonna game for a little while
Mmm
Tmr I've got essay and apush and some cs
U can do apush on Friday lol
What do u have to do tmr?
Mmm
But the gacha in this game
I got into fgo cuz fate
I used to play idle heroes and it was pretty good
Idk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oIKsaVD0Bk
*do not try this in real life*
Instant A
Lmao
If u mark me down for being late then u should also mark down ur harsh grading on essays for giving us our essays back late
She isn't gonna do anything g
It's a few minutes late lmao
Something along those lines
Sorry I turned it in late, had something I wanted to fix
All I said was
So switch should be a good deal
Better on controller than kbm
It's great so I've heard
This game is great
So is Jack the ripper
Marie Antoinette is a loli in this game

Heh
Yes, today at like 5pm
Prem can we call later today for cs
Gotta reward myself a little for being productive today
I turned off my phone lock for this night
Time to play a little fgo
Hopefully I don't get hungry again
I was so hungry last night at 2 30
First time I've worked my brain in a bit
God I'm tired...
Watch as when I get it back and look back over it it's utter garbage
I'm happy
I think the stuff I wrote can fetch an OK grade
Lmao
Mmm
He dressed and danced the dance
He was well known and accepted by the elite
He was elite
He did say he earned more than anyone else his age
He was rich before too tho
I was pretty happy with my fire analogy
I just said it's not love and that's its obsession
Mmm
That's what I did
Just tell her about it
I've done that before
Ye
Ppl usually don't change that much
I feel like that's a little inconsistent tbh
Mmm
Lol
So I wrote him into that
I thought he was creepy
For which #?
Mmm
So hopefully if I left any here it'll be fine
I usually do the similar retarded mistakes in my in class essays and those never changed anything
And tell me what u think plz
Just read
I just turned it in
So nvm
Ye
Cuz I'm too fucking dumb to do it myself
So I usually ask prem to catch them for me lol
I usually lead small but very retarded mistakes in my stuff after I edit it myself
Proofread a little plz
Nj7240?
Aight
I'm actually happy with my #4 so I hope I don't get shat on
Aight I shared it
So whatever
I was a minute late before but now I had to unsubmit to reshars
I'll turn it in a little late ig lol
Actually just proofread it
O
4504?
The numbers
Ninjastrike what was it
O I just shared with school
And tell me what u think
Just read #3 and #4
@Anaani Muss
Ugh
When's that due
I'm happy with how my #4 turned out
@pornhub PREMium
But I wanna see
I just turned it in
Prem can u still read my stuff
Aight in done
Structure rule?
Descriptions and everything

Actually wait
Dialogue and descriptions and stuff
U know how normal books go?
Aight ima just say it without color then
What color were her eyes
But it should work
My #1 kinda weak
Mmm
Bruh
Oma8
I can bet no one in this chat has seen more sus shit than I have
I am and always have been the master of sus shit

Ima be romantically attracted to my stomachaches bruh
Bruh lmao
But I have them so often now I just function normally cuz I'm used to it...
I used to do that with stomachaches
O rip
Kiran do u have time to proofread rq by any chance?
O well I think my #3 is fine
Poggerd
"..."
That's what I use
...
Lol
I just need someone to proofread it so I don't leave some stupid mistakes like I usually do
@Will Liang ?
Rip
I'll share with u
Prem can u read my #3 rn
I need to proofread this in a bit
My #3 is thicco
Mmm
I'd be depressed
Imagine being a team that lost to some guy with anime stickers
If it works it works
That's the word I would've gone with
He's basically a cuck
Like cuck
Just use a different word
I said I felt sorry for him but that he was an idiot and it's his fault
U should've just called him a simp then
Y did it take so long?
O
Ima have to come back to #1 to choose a quote out of the three I have
Ig I shouldn't be worried
That took like 2 minutes lol
I finished #2
Mmm
Prem if I finish before it's due can u proofread
Bruh lmao
Mmm
Three quotes
Lemme see what quote I'll pick for #1
Aight
Fucked *
If I get a stomachache now I'm fuck
Actually ig I'll just find out myself rn
How long does it take to answer all the questions
3 pages left
Aight I should finish reading the story now

It's past afternoon
She said afternoon tho
Pepperridge farm remembers
Remember when dagen said she'd give us our essays back today?
That's the difference between a freshman and a fifth grader lol
But 11 and 14
Like 51 and 48 doesn't meant Jack
The 3 years between 11 and 14 r 3 big years
This guy do be kinda pedo tho
Looks like I'll have a lot of choices in the end
Neat
I found another paradox right under that first one
Huh
O that's kind of a paradox
I'm tired from working hard at procrastination
Whoops
O I did?
It seems contradictory but it shows how it reaches its conclusion in a logical way
Ye that one
But it's hopefully not gonna be my quote
Too lazy to type 8t
It fits the definition of paradox perfectly tho
U have to have the reasoning behind it for it to be a paradox
Ofc it won't sound like a paradox if it's two words
Lmao
I said two words of the sentence
What
Ye
Ima try to find another one
It's so early on too
Neat
The beautifully lovely one is a paradox
The rest is prem carrying me tho
I'm utter garbage but I get B's on tests somehow
Similarly saying I'm not bad at apcs is also a paradox
But he's bad at apush
It is technically true because he has an A
A paradox would be will is not bad at apush
Alright
9 pages
Lmao
Prem y do u sound so passive aggressive
Nows as good a time as any
Mentally exhausted and physically dying
Time to start reading
Ima just email her again and remind her ig
Smh
Y has mine not gotten signed yet

@Gatsby
Bk did u get urs back?
Have u?
I still haven't gotten it back
Ik
Or at least hasn't returned it signed
My counselor still hasn't signed my form


Eating *
Gonna read after I finish reading
Advanced writing courses?
Before I read the story
Time to play more fgo
Idk
Aside from writing ig
Being a good writer doesn't necessarily mean ur smart or good at anything useful
Not everyone can write a good essay tho
Test bad
I don't like tests
I'm fine with gpa
I bet that's his hidden meaning
Read it slow
Combust
He bout to bust
Using an overused joke is just an overused joke
Thank God
It's becoming a dead meme
Simping is so overused
Bruh that's not what simping is
No
He's done it again
What a rebuttal
Ig I'm in a slump rn
I put fmab on hold too
Busy grinding fgo
I haven't been watching for the last two days
And I'll still beat ur bitchass
I'll start reading at 11 30
I'll up the challenge
It'll save me time
Lmao
Yeah but I can bs them in like 5 minutes
Actually underlining is easier
Just gotta do some bs highlighting
Aight I ain't watching the review vid
That'd be nice
I wish I could see it everytime I sent a message like on discord
I like my pfp
Prem how long did the apush thing take I
O I don't like how that looks
What's a fade?
Fulton soc sems?
Remember last year?
Lmao

How long does the apush thing take
Language barriers r a bitch
Cuz both my struggles were similar
Then I'll talk about both fifth grade and last year ig
O I can talk about more than one instance?
That's what I thought
I'll prolly talk about grinding for Fulton final
I don't have anything more recent since last year lol
Ez
Then I'll just talk about last year
Hmm
?
Cuz I have a nice story from fifth grade lol
But I like the #4 uc one
Can I not?
Idk
Tho I'll have to go pick four either way cuz I'm mostly applying uc
I'm using one for personal statement for common app :/
O I'm looking at the uc prompts
Cuz will told me so lmao
Rekt
Poopyhead
Hehe

I'll use that prompt
U see #4?
Hmm
Ill just use the prompts to guide me
I took like three minutes to come up with mine so I'll just figure it out again
Could u send me a link to the prompts?
Lemme look at the prompts again
O I have a plan for mine but I don't remember anymore
Personal statement?
I can read later
Ima play some fgo now
Welp
I didn't remember the authors name right
No no
I knew the winter dreams thing was due today
I'm retarded
Y did I think it was related to the great Gatsby
Nothing related to the great Gatsby right
The winter dreams thing is due today
Wait
Aight time to start reading
I'm fuck

At 6 maybe
And before that I have to finish my psych stuff
I have to read the story first ._.

Damn gotem
Well it didn't really change ur grade so ur fine
I was so high strung at that point I prolly would've
As in if it happened to someone next to me
I wonder if that happened if I would start laughing
Abhishek is the only monkey
Prem is only a goon
There is no higher tier of monkey than him
He missed a whole essay
What the hell is my math teacher gonna do lol
Legit just won't do any hw that isn't dagen or psych
I'm free
If the q3 thing is what ends up passing
Print it urself
U can use unofficial one
Tho I grinded like hell
Wait the Fulton final wasn't that hard
Otherwise idk
So I assume they'll handle it some other way
My counselor responded but hasn't returned the sheet signed or anything
F
This would come as no surprise to the young Taiwanese man who wrote more than 700 letters to his girlfriend, urging her to marry him. She did marrythe mail carrier

Cellulose isn't a cell lol
Stem cells r literally beta versions of other cells
That's a beta molecule
And if stem cells r beta, so is stem
So they're basically beta cells
Cuz stem cells can become other cells
Stem is beta
Ur welcome
Underlining puts a line under them

Gaming and occasionally browsing reddit
Lmao
Gj
Nick
I filled like two and a half pages with charts on the last outline lmao
So ez copy paste
We type it now cuz we turn in to Google classroom
I padded my last outline by copy pasting charts
Shit this psych unit has like no charts
Uh oh
It says confirmation # next to it lol
Nope
So just use those to tell which class u should sign up for
Laspa lists the start and end dates for each class too right
Idk for Amador
For laspo
I mean if there is a spring course u could choose that, I think
Bruh lmao
Or did u mean summer 2020
Summer 2021 is way later lol
Fall 2020
Welp I should start working on my psych outline today
It's like 5 points so I could just skip it...
One day?
Tf
Unit 3 review due Thursday

Everyone has their weak and strong points
Will would tell u otherwise
Read it a second time if u didn't get it the first time
Since the final ig
Besides, it's been a while since I last watched anime in that class
I'm just better at learning history than u :)
Just cuz I'm not paying attention doesn't mean I don't learn it all
Am I not learning everything the class has to offer?
Bruh the ap test is 45 minutes lmao
Dennis time
That is how it should be
Take the class to learn everything it offers
U shouldn't take a class just for the ap exam
Wjatever
I'll just do it on the day it's due then
O well
Bruh
Really?
Wait what
Ima have to start working on last psych outline
When is the next apush outline due

Amazing
Just gave Brian a pack of hentai games for his birthday
B
When in doubt
Check cs server
@Graydon Perry
The fuck is that sorcery
How tf do u make good curry with whole potatoes
And incest hentai as well
God would be proud of all the step sister porn out there
That's what's important here
God loves incest
But still
Yes
Good times
Luke how he forced a bunch of animals and a few ppl to commit continuous incest in order to repopulate the planet
God reveals his dirty secrets
Nah it's cuz of the creepers
The sun is a cross dresser

The sun genderbends and becomes the moon
Prem's joke?
Wait what r u talking about
Ye
I got tired of it
My prediction became true for me
Hmm
Or I didn't register it
Fuck I didn't see that line
O wait
I am tested indeed
Tho ur not will so ur prolly joking
I can't tell if ur joking or not rn
...
He can summon a broom from elsewhere
Like in Harry Potter
The sun doesn't just disappear from the universe when it's night
Bruh
Yall should learn how to read better tho :/
That show wasn't exactly a good show...
Or creates one, can't remember how it goes exactly
He summons a sun
He doesn't use the actual sun
Keyword is summon
And shooting it, iirc
Literally creating/summoning a small sun
It's his noble phantasm
No he can summon it at night
What, is the sun not hot?
When he summons the sun yeah
Very high temperature when he literally summons the sun
Son of a sun God
I'd say karna from fate apocrypha is hot as fuck
Doesn't matter
Some id they give u on the application portal
Wait a few days
Cccid is different
It is a religious thing
Someone outside is playing trumpets
I don't have it now tho :(
There's a picture out there of cutouts of her face taped onto little cockroaches
Yes but no
Ima apply there
There's a college called azusa pacific university
O shit
Well that's great
Guess I'll take the online version instead
I didn't take that many classes that I'm at liberty to skip nex year...
This one course I'm really interested in is mw at fucking 9am
Gdi
Mmm
Rate my professors is useful now
Aight
3.00
Just the number they have in their chart?
Also what r u supposed to put for units
So just wait ig
Got email on 8th
I finished my application on January 5th
It took them 3 days to send me the email
Maybe it takes a bit for them to send the email
Huh
O
In it they tell u ur student id
The email should pop up
In the search bar type in Las posits College admissions application
Just go to the same email u used for application
It's w10 and then a bunch of other numbers
Since I did my app hella early my email was back in January lmao
They send u it in ur application confirmation email
Found an email from back in January lmao
O nvm
Or do I have to go somewhere else to find it
Is the lpc student ID the same thing as the cccid
Ima get the form when I'm done eating
Mmm
Aight bet
So just send it to counseler and have them take care of it?
Or whatever they have
O so u don't email laspo directly?
The one they gave on the registration website?
Which email to?
Or do u
So u don't email it in?
Their campus is closed right
Email pictures?
Also how do we send these forms in
Maybe it was just my end or something
There was a page on their website I tried to open but gave me 404
Bruh
I see he's not in a mood to be helpful rn...
Didn't u just do this
@Will Liang
Is the catalogue where u find the courses with their names and stuff
O ffs
Y is the catalogue blank for me

Cuz when I'm done eating I gotta start the hw I've been delaying
I have like no free time on work days
Except on work days
My free time usually goes from the time school ends to when I choose to sleep
Rn I'm being consumed by rewatching so I'm not making much progress on my watchlist
Now I've just got more time to kill
I mean I had more than enough free time before
Tho I don't get worn down when I'm staying over in China...
And that takes only a month lol
But by the end of summer I always look forwards to school
Rn it feels ok
I hope this doesn't wear on me
I feel like I've been on an endless summer break...

Not even my first choice lmao
Anthropology ._.

U sure u wanna increase ur debt?
The only thing on my schedule is psych
Lmao
Well played

Sometimes I'm glad they removed r/enoughinternet
Fuck those r some unpleasant memories
I've seen weirder shit with grown women before...

U can't even begin to imagine the stuff that's out there
There is some weird shit out there Kiran

Everyone's just used to it now lmao
It's cuz I do it so often :/
Or sometimes both
I send ones that r either funny or weird shit
Lmao
I wouldn't send it if it wasn't
Ik it's weird shit
I mean
I lost track
What r u guys even talking about now?
That ain't consent
Like videos of preteens sodomizing themselves?

Wait child porn?
Wait is it hentai or is it just fanart of something?
Shouldnt be hard
It's been around for a while
I don't wanna go back to six digits

Fine fine
Smh
Lmao

I can have conversations with ppl over discord vc from my bed when my headphones r up on the opposite wall because they can get so loud lmao
Tho I can prolly hear everything clearly at 125% from my bed
And use my headphones as speakers
Jack vlc to 200%

Bruh lmao
Tho I did get my vn copy from there too
Its just torrenting for anime
Nyaa
I always get it from this one website
And streaming services r way too quiet, I gotta jack the volume up to 125 on vlc
Cuz I don't want all the fucking compression and shit
If I ever decide to rewatch a show I always get a bdrip
Blu-ray quality is so much higher than streaming man
Or maybe it already released on the Chinese anime site and someone already downloaded itn
I guess I'll just have to wait for blu-ray releases...
But I can't watch it anyways... :/
And my favorite studio just released a trailer for the movie I've been waiting for
Bruh he already got accepted like a month ago lmao
@Will Liang got rmp interview
I do it pretty often when I'm not thinking

The best liars aren't the ones that lie often
Best lier idk...
Lmao
I like how ur calling the other kid out for capping now
Without the scar it's harder to believe lol
That is true
@Abhishek Koul is he buying ur cap lmao

@Will Liang
I was past saving to begin with
Truly reaching new levels today
And I just purchased my first figurine
How far I've fallen
I'm watching a show worse than no game no life...
No season 2
There's a movie
I don't have the right to condemn that anymore
...
The reason I found it garbage is cuz it sexualized a 12 year old
Actually wait
That show is garbage
No game no life
O
Lmao fauci got censored by Trump
At least they're not saying it's a liberal hoax anymore right
What good is that stockpile gonna do if u don't use it lmao
I'd keep the kids out of it but yeah
Bruh lmao
Boris Johnson said he was shaking hands with coronavirus patients just weeks before he tested positive for Covid-19.
Like this British idiot
https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/27/i-shook-hands-with-everybody-says-boris-johnson-weeks-before-coronavirus-diagnosis-video
I don't like saying this but I wouldn't mind if they caught the virus too...
Can't let their ego catch the virus
I guess the administration has a big enough ego that they need that whole stockpile to protect it
https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/stockpile-website-edited-kushner-claim/index.html
The website of the Strategic National Stockpile was edited on Friday to soften language about how the stockpile is supposed to be used by states -- a day after media outlets reported that the original version contradicted a claim by senior White House official Jared Kushner.
Kushner, President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, said at Thursday's coronavirus briefing that states themselves have medical equipment stockpiled -- and argued that "the notion of the federal stockpile was it's supposed to be our stockpile; it's not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use."
They're not even using any of the stuff in the stockpile I'm pretty sure
The federal govt just has a stockpile lmao
Cuz later it just goes into the crisis and what Kentucky wants to do
I didn't read the whole thing
I don't think the article said
Some company
Then the mom comes in, slaps the kid, buys the gum for $100 then sticks in her pocket without even eating it
Overpriced but the kid wants the gum
It's like a kid brought $10 to an auction to buy a pack of gum or some shit
Ikr
Lmao
Um

When u don't know what to do with the expanding suburbs after ww2

MIT gender studies
Bruh
Cuz MIT pro
This show is holding me hostage
Then I went to watch the movie for it and now I'm back...
And threw it out of my watch list
Immediately exited out of the show
Saw what was happening
Yesterday I got to this one scene
It's the real deal
It's not even bait
Wait the show I'm watching rn isn't even bait anymore
Bait like the shows I watch
Gotem
My gpu
Ugh
Just like my

Riverside stronk school Bruh
Bruh eecs worse than riverside
Well I'm fucking allergic to seafood so fuck me ig
Lmao
Inb4 rejected by riverside
It really do be like that
Yall have it hard with ur cs major lmao
Rip
Flex
Isn't that what u want for colleges
I mean
Cuz it shows ur not trash
Then u would want to have it regardless right
Is that 5% random tho
Since they ask for it
So would it be severe disadvantage to apply to MIT without aime
Lmao I can ever keep track of these stupid math competitions in my head cuz they don't matter for me
I forget if prem did
Rip
Wait will have u done amie?
Welp
Rip lmao
Bruh we should all apply to Trump University
Bruh gender studies best major
Can't relate
Imagine going for a competitive major
But it won't be as hard cuz I'm not a cs 
I mean cruise is an overstatement
Lmao
Then when I told her I was going for psych she completely changed attitude and was like yeah you'll get in no problem
When I asked Fulton if she thought I could get into Berkeley she was like kinda hesitant
It's what ppl who don't know what to do apply for
Lmao
It's usually known as the dud major
Let's go
Then ima cruise in on psych
Aight bet
Lmao
O shit
Hey let's all inflate prems hopes for getting into MIT so we can clown him if he fails
Doesn't Berkeley not care about what major u apply for
I liked the city too so triple win for me
Berkeley pretty goated ngl
Berkeley be #1 target
Berkeley is nice cuz I'll fs have ppl ik go there too
Mmm
Cmu is #2 rn
MIT #1
Wait Berkeley is #3 now
V nice
Berkeley #1 psych
Which felt really random lmao
#7 psych for some reason
Nmhm
That's pretty good
Damn uiuc #6
If I don't get accepted anywhere else sure
Lmao
Not all uc r bay area
I mean
Well watch it again
I'm sure that will cheer u up
Watch your lie in April
Isn't uiuc actually good for cs
Well I guess I have my college list down
Can't relate
Imagine having a hard time getting into uiuc
Whichever one is lower
So my lowest uc is ucsb or ucsd
I cut off at Santa Cruz
Nope
My super safety is uiuc
Nope

Cuz there's still a chance I'll get shat on by Irvine or something, idk
So the other 5/6 r all safety, with one being super safety
I don't have a single reach and I've only got 4 targets
My apps r like 60% safety lmao
Can't relate
Imagine having reach schools
Imagine having more than 3 apps to write
Well now I'm looking forwards to next year
Ima be cruising next year just like this year
Yeah I think my hardest class is gonna be Chem lmao
Those singlehandedly destroyed my grade sem1
I'm not too worried about getting a B cuz we don't have any fucking grammar tests
Regardless
I'm looking forwards to Fulton next year tho
Calc ab is 
Cuz Fulton kinda chilling next year
My hardest class next year prolly gonna be chem
Imagine taking ap physics
Well ig I'll cruise senior year too ._.
Can't be that bad
Lmao
Then I have 3 apps to write
All uc's use the same app right?
Umich and UT Austin
Then I'll just the uc app
Aight so ima just dig up a random summer cmao essay when uiuc ea rolls around
Copy paste or shrink/expand a little
Hehe
So I can copy paste
I've already written that for summer camps
Makes sense ig
Mmm
So I'm not very concerned about doing ea
I mean I'm pretty sure I'll get in uiuc no matter what lmao
Uc doesn't have early actions right
Cuz my target schools r all uc :/
Yuup
Looking at my list
I don't think ima do early action or decision at all lmao
Hey I was born there
I just put in whatever colleges have good psych
They're all targets or backups
I don't have a single reach college lol
My list for now
UT Austin actually pretty high for psych so I put it in my list too
And put uiuc in as worst case backup lol
I cut out Santa Cruz
Lmao
Most of them r uc lol
I just built a quick list of 9 colleges
The Berkeley city felt lived in
Lmao
Am I like the only person who kinda liked the city of Berkeley
I want Berkeley
Mmm
Gotem
Just like ur mum
Ooo can I see
I hate spreadsheets
Prem do u know where ur applying to yet?
Hmm
I should figure out what colleges to apply to
That surprised me
Had no idea Michigan was so good at psych tho lol
Uiuc safety then
Aight bet
Stanford safety
Prolly even easier for psych lmao
Lemme see if I can find by major
O that's true
It has like 65% acceptance lmao
Ig uiuc will be safety
My list will just be a bunch of uc's, uiuc, Michigan and whatever
And I'm gonna do graduate school regardless so
Cuz I don't wanna waste my money applying to a school I won't get into
Except I'll leave out ivy schools and Stanford
I'm just gonna pull from the list of best colleges for psych and apply to those lol
Uiuc isn't common app
Hmm
So the one personal question is for non-uc
That works for me then
Ok
O for uc there isn't a personal question?
But my target is uc
A few
I'm gonna go for non uc's as well
Well I'm gonna go for uc's
And the rest as the four questions
So would I choose one as personal statement
So that leaves me with 5
I'll stay away from #1, 7, and 8
Gotem
For #4 I could talk about what I did in fifth grade
Lmao
Fulton presentation
The creativity one
Lemme see
So choose one for personal statement
O
Ps?
350 words
4 out of 8 questions
Hmm
I've got nothing better to do so I might just write it over break
Wait what exactly is the personal statement
O
Can someone send me essay prompts for uc's
Hmm
I wonder if I'll share my personal statement with anyone
His z score?
Prolly back to fmab
Idk where I'll go from there
And then I'll be done with the nasuverse
After that I have one more show
And then a series of 8 movies
And then I have two more vn
Then I've just got like 16 books
And then two routes of my vn
I've got 17 episodes left in this show
Bruh gotem
R u guys talking about something else?
Aadithyaa thought
After I burn through this anime ima get back to my vn
Can't relate
Imagine already doing ur college essays
Cc
Ima write them this summer ig
Mmm
Can't relate
But imagine stimulating ur mind instead of just reading and watching stuff all day
But I never was really into them
I'm OK with puzzles
Well riddles in particular
I've always been bad at puzzles and riddles and the like
Icic
O idk what that is
What's this?
?
I have become the top and u the bottom
Now u no longer have anything over me
We used to trade blows with flexing
But will, u r not immune to my flexing
So I meant summer camps won't matter
Most ppl won't be able to go to any camps anymore lol
I am hereby immune to ur flexing for this year
But summer won't matter anymore so
Haha
Will u have nothing over me for junior year now
And when u look at the one other class we have in common
So we cancel out
But then I can flex q3
I am very happy with my grades
Mmm
Damn
O 91
I've seen her cross out A- for A
88.5-90.5 would be my guess
Rip
With an online pdf
I checked all my answers immediately after taking it lol
I think I got one thing wrong on that test
I guess so
Holy shit what did I do
So I pulled at least like 3%
I jumped from B+ to flat A
What did I do
Holy fucc
Jumped from B+
I mad pulled back
U can no longer flex dagen grade on me
Will
Wait wait wait
Wait
Bruh
Or r u sad over A- :/
U still had an A right
Bruh
Marks
Ye
Won't matter if option 1
Boost GPA
I like option 1
Abhishek is just speculating I'm pretty sure
U gotta ask him
I'd be happy with this being my final grade
I'm very happy with my 3rd quarter grades
Mmm
I kinda got clowned on the dbq cuz I was being rart
He got clapped on dbq
U rart
Read the whole option will
I had the foresight of knowing I'd bee too. Lazy to read them anyways so I didn't buy them
Everyone who bought ap prep books this year kinda wasted their money lmao.
Holy fuck everything is coming together
With pretty much every summer program getting canceled, I can have a free summer too
I'd have even more time to waste than I do now
That'd be perfect
Mmm
Bio cuz I don't wanna fail ap test so I'll do the practice tests
Well if option 1 gets passed ill only ever do dagen psych and bio hw
Bruh lmao
And I meant spring break as in this

Yes ik
Depending on the bio hw tho actually
I'll only do dagen, psych, and bio hw
If it gets passed before spring break ends goodbye compsci
So no hw rn
I mean we're in spring break...
That's y I'm praying for it
Then I won't have to deal with my math class ever again
Plz option 1
This is amazing
Cuz the grade can't go down
I can just not do hw
This is perfect
Wait
Cuz then this bio thing won't affect me
Then yeah option 1 is best
O
Prem I'm pretty sure option 1 means ur 3rd quarter report card is ur final grade
Cuz that was after 3rd quarter
That won't matter
Thing is
But
That's how
Weighted categories and little hw
I emailed him but no reply yet
And that 0 dropped my grade by 12%...
I just need to fix my bio grade rq cuz I forgot one assignment
Plz
This way the new dagen assignments won't rape my grade
Plz plz plz
3rd quarter plz
Yes plz
Yes
Um
It's obvious I didn't watch them at least
Since I'd never heard of them.
Well.
What videos?
Chibi loli
Time to run like a child who sees his priest
Gotem
Sniped bitch
Gotem
Unlike ur mum
Today I don't feel like doing it
Nah
Gotem
Vrv is so quiet
Sniped
And then there's the rest of the movie
The movie for this show and parts of it r so good
Gotem
Find to watch the worst and best show
Aight enough gaming for today
Damn gotem
Should I ask Fulton and rozelle rn?
Hmm
Rozelle is great
So ima assume the same for college apps
I straight up asked her if she'd give me a good rec letter for summer programs and she said yes
She doesn't care
Yes
Ye
Psych
Fulton and rozelle
Me?
Will ur kinda bad
...
R they gonna give u a good rec?
I can't believe u don't already have teachers in mind lmao
Ask next year
Bruh lmao
Don't u already know who ur asking?
So that's whatever
But we're all gonna get good recs somehow anyways
And that
So it comes down to ec, GPA, and essays
So GPA will still matter
And some schools still have grades for this sem
Grades from last sem and sophomore year r still there
I mean
Since it isn't up to who's better to get in but about who's lucky enough for theirs not to get canceled
So colleges prolly won't care about summer programs as much
A shit ton of others r
I mean even if rmp doesn't get canceled
Smh
Had to reinstall the stupid thing
Gboard is fucking gay but Swiftkey broke for some reason
what the hell happened
had to uninstall my keyboard
fuck
So I'll be on even ground regardless
Cuz a lot of kids won't have anything this summer cuz or that
So I don't really mind
Pretty much everything is getting canceled
Lol
Haven't gotten anything
This show is holding me hostage
But the movie for it is so good
Illya prisma is so problematic
Mmm
Guess I'll sleep my hunger off...
What the fuck
U am I hungry when I should be asleep.
Fuck I'm hungry
Two ppl trying to not get embarrassed and making up bullshit to avoid it
It is called
It's popular this season
That show
Ah
Today I took a break from one of those cuz I was too busy reading
Tho I only started the reading part a week or two ago
I haven't taken a break from gaming and reading and watching anime in three weeks
God the opening to this show is amazing
Time to take a break
Halfway done

No theses?
If I feel too annoyed with it tho I'll just sleep and take the points off
Yeah I'm planning to finish tonight
Well I might as well finish fast forwarding my vn before I start...
Oh my fucking God
I forgot all about the apush outline
FUCK
O
Wait
blursed more like
Prem bouta become a cam girl
Prem fulfilled his nickname
Fuck
And though the game would just keep going past the prologue
I forgot that after the prologue I was supposed to hit start
Oh my God I'm retarded
Now I gotta start over
Son of a bitch
It crashed
God fucking damn it
Guess ima just have to watch stuff on my phone as I use something to hold down my keyboard and skip
Even fast forwarding is taking forever...
That's like four straight days of reading
But if I wanna use it ima lose aall my progress
I found a better, patched version of the visual novel I was reading
Ugh
Will start when I finish my vn
Now I just gotta do an outline today
Fat dub for me
Maybe I'm reading it wrong
Could u check just to make sure
Lmao
So ig I'm not doing the frq thing until then
Also prem sos said everything due since the start of remote learning can be turned in for full credit until end of spring break
But still
I'm not disappointed or anything
I was kinda interested in what she'd give us tho
Just saw that too
Mmm
Damn this shit kinda good
https://youtu.be/v4xZUr0BEfE
Bye bye to grades
So I can use their grades as leverage to get food
I told the freshmen who signed up for honors English that I hope to get them in the period I ta for
I can't remember if he signed up for it next year
Well he's still just a freshmen, he'll prolly be able to sort it out
Lmao
He gets the same way aadithyaa does now that I think of it
This freshmen
Lmao
I did it once before and he said I was toxic or something
Ikr
@Abhishek Koul he gets so offended when ppl say fortnite is bad lmao

No exceptions
Everyone gets C for participation
Yes
I keep having to breathe through my mouth cuz my nose is being difficult
God y is my nose such a bitch
Bruh lmao
Yeah ima play my vn instead
No lecture notes and just a 4 page outline...
R there theses?
Should I start the apush outline now
Sometimes I have an idea that is contradicted by the evidence so I just discredit the evidence lmao
Except with dbq u can just argue against the evidence
Same thing with synthesis vs argument essay lol
Its an leq except u don't need to think for urself
Real clown hours lmao
They have made it even easier than apwh was last year somehow
Well time to cop ez 5 on apush
I don't really care what psych is, I'll be fine regardless
And what frq for cs
I wonder what frq I'll get for bio
Hmm
R all the times and stuff out already?
Tests *
Ap gets?
For what
Exam?
Omai
Dagen is assigning two things due next week
M0mm
I should
I should start the apush outline
Aight bet
I am terminally brain dead and require assistance
@pornhub PREMium can u help me with cs grading thing
But cuz it was late it didn't save progress :/
Ye I did it before
I didn't know I had to click to a different app from the stupid fucking page
Like me
She reassigned it cuz a lot of us didn't do it
Launchpad
O bey
Yes but I need to take extra notes to fake lecture notes
Senior year first sem is gonna be death I'm p sure
Then I'll start the apush outline
Then I'll play through day 14 of my vn
That'll take me twenty minutes
Ima start by doing my math copying and psych thing
One route down, two routes to go
Ima finish the first route of my vn today tho
So I gotta sacrifice two hours of my time
Two hours *
So that's like an hour of work today
A few minutes of psych
Some cs thing
An outline
Lmao
I just told u
Have an outline to do first
I've got more than ten minutes worth of hw today
Hw
Damn it
I have work today
Ah
After my vn I should be able to get through illya prisma
I have arrived at a new level of degeneracy
It drove me away but now I'm back
I've returned to illya prisma
Nice

Does someone want some numbers?
I have been summoned
Wait what
Yed
He's gonna send his steam code there
Ima add u to our rozelle chat real quick
Hmm
Bruh lmao
He do be waiting for a reply
Graydon do u wanna 1v1 Brian or no?
Gold 3 in comp
In wingman he was master guardian 2
He made it to gold 2 or 3
Not pro but he's good
Lmao
Ur gonna get raped tho
Brian Lee can 1v1 u in csgo
Or he might
Brian is down
Graydon
That'd be kinda cool
I've always wanted to try and see if I can grow enough to have a topknot
Actually
Once they get long enough and annoy me enough I'll go for it
Ye I intend to
Wouldn't even need to bother washing my hair or drying it
Cuz y not
Ive been thinking about just going bald for now
Makes sense
Cut ur chin and the hair on ur scalp goes away
Cut ur hair
Yes
Gotem
One of the last 3d shows I ever watched
Good show
But I'm too lazy to shave them
I have like a few hairs on my chin and it's annoying
Or at least have been ambidextrous
I feel like if I'd tried I could've made my left hand my dominant hand
I just use whichever
Like for pool
Otherwise I use my hands interchangeably
My right hand is for writing, chopsticks, and mouse movement
My left hand is useful for scrolling on my phone and repeatedly pressing wasd
What do u use ur left hand for then
Hmm
O
Don't hand shame
Some ppl use the left hand
The rest of the coders
:)
I retired from competing
Oliver Trevor has more prom dates than the rest of the coders here combined
That is not untrue for coders here
Indeed
Gotem
Ur mum
More like
Nah
Ur a bigger nerd than I ever could be
U code
I hope I can balance it right to get the good end
Only two more routes to go
Almost done with the first route of my vn
Mmm
I had to take the opening
Gotem
Ur mum
Korea has some big ass dog farms
The soup isn't expensive I don't think
U could just buy one in Korea or China
https://youtu.be/dQ_d_VKrFgM
Go back to where u belong
Garbage
4d is trash
But that is one exception
2d is better than 3d
But they help predators as well
Horns r a natural protection against predators
Bruh lmao
After like 6 hours under the Mediterranean sun
I almost got sunburnt once in Greece
I never liked sunscreen
It did happen to me
That's the joke lol
I'm surprised I only ever got sunburnt once
Can't relate
Imagine being born with normal light skin and getting the hell tanned out of u
He just looks white lmao
Can't tell
Is he white or Indian?
His face looks like one idubbz would make
The fuck is wrong with this app
Those videos break messenger
What
I can't tell if it's meant to be ironic
Is that the content the dude usually puts out?
...
Fax
I don't care about the college credit
I don't want to take that test
I'd want to remove my apcs test if I can tho...
I can't remember info I don't care about for more than like a month lol
I'd be fucked for bio if I tried to
I don't want to take these tests next year
I mean
Mmm
Is that confirmed?
So none of them give college cred this year?
Mmm
Like the week before
I should study a little for bio
Did u study for the psych ap test?
Aw
Prem will become my cs notebook
Y worry
Bruh it's open note now lmao
Prolly would throw up if I tried again
Can't relate
Imagine enjoying seafood
Can't relate
Bruh imagine being taller and having a higher chance of getting cancer
So graydon's opinion on food is invalid
And British ppl make the worst food
Which means part of him is for sure British
Graydon is part Irish
His opinion doesn't count
We've objectified him
Nah Kiran isn't human
Uncultured
Smh
Sweet potatoes r a blessing from God

Ur a daft cow
Fuck u
Fuck these sweet potatoes r good
Imagine not already having naked pictures of Kiran
Gotem
Ur mum
There
Wait I need a picture befitting this
Shit
Can I apply as the sex slave
Weak
Imagine doing drug cartels instead of human trafficking rings
Bruh u ain't underage enough to charge that price
Kiran ur a possession
Smh
Show some respect to king Arthur
She ain't naked
Ay
I'm decensitized
Cap
Nothing to worry about then
When is it due tmr?
A whole book worth of K's
Look at my K's
Bitchass
Kiran
Kiran u weak lookin ass
Bruh ima pull out a whole book worth of K's
Turmoil would've been a good word
I said some vague bullshit about chaos and violence
Let's see
#9 on apush doc?
Wow that was way longer than I was planning to sleep for
I just slept for an hour and a half
Holy
@Will Liang
@Will Liang  can u call
Brian what's ur discord

Can't relate
Imagine being over sensitive
Imagine caring what other ppl talk about
Ye
I like traps
For hoarding?
Imagine running outside
I am #1
Total messages
See who says ur mom or ur mum the most
By percentage I was like #4 in cussing
Send the total messages one too
Due to the sheer volume of messages I send compared to everyone else
Me
I have finally mastered how to cook my own wings
This smells good
Mmm
I think my chicken is done
Gotem
I see no joke here aside from u
And they're obviously not immune at all
U don't get sick from European ppl killing each other
Smallpox doesn't spread through food
Obviously
D
Bruh
Gotem
Anime memes r back, time to refill my coffers
A true thinker
He is the next Sigmund Freud
Hold ur power button then
If u vote to kick will click alt and f4
Gotem
Unlike ur mum
It's been so long since I've worn a hat
Gotem
Just like Australia
Imagine needing to wear a hat
o_{
Problems must be removed
Gotem
Gotem
Well
Fuck I was gonna say that
I was talking about
That's cap
Nah
Doesn't matter which ballpark u play for
We aren't talking abut ur sexuality
The student has surpassed the master
That is more cap than abhishek has ever created
He said he's never horny
Aadithyaa can
Ur mum
More like
Ethan
I agree with that statement
U never cap aside from when u cap
Yes yes
When u add them all together
The amount of cap I see in those two photos surpasses almost everything abhishek has ever said
Lmao
I've ever seen
That is the funniest shit
...
Gotem
Gotem
Just like ur mum
Gotem
Ur mum
@pornhub PREMium ur fine with Brian joining too right?
So an hour should be ez
I glanced at the questions and they don't seem that hard
Let's see if we can finish in an hour so I can catch a nap at 5
Get ready cuz we be doing it at 4
Bruh lmao.
If he did then ig not
Did he say yes?
Prem, will, and I
We have a spot open still I think
Omai
Anime should have more stopping power than tic tok
If I wanna stop an arg ig I can just post anime pics
U poopyhead
Ima start an argument right here
Hey
Mmm
It was my analogy for it lmao
That wasn't the boundary
It wasn't imperialism
So I came up with something else to continue my train of thought
I was honestly a little too embarrassed to say the second part
Everyone was busting their guts and that was when I decided I'd pushed up to a bound
I never got to say that last part tho
But Wilson would do it nice and slow and stay in for their "own good"
Teddy Roosevelt fucked them hard and fucked them fast but he pulled out
Yeah that's about right
I said something along the lines of
Others just slip my mind really quickly
I'm really good at remembering some things
My memory is weird
O I don't remember that lol
Would've *
Any further and I wouldn't been beyond my own comfort zone lmao
Then I stopped there
I pushed up until the day I said the imperialism thing
It was partly me pushing the boundary in that class as well
Mmm
If I'm not or if I'm amused I call them retarded
I think I call ppl idiots when I'm genuinely angry or annoyed
Not really cuz I was angry at anyone or anything
I just did it
That would just be a beat down
A conflict entails two parties
I mean that's not really a conflict
To no one's shock and surprise
I'm incompatible with aadithyaa in Lang groups
Actually Lang
I don't think I've ever gotten into a conflict in classes before
Lmao
If it's just a calm debate then I'd only care about the subject matter
Ig I just need some type of special reaction?
I find it fun with aadithyaa cuz he gets all pretentious
And it's just funny
Cuz u would picture him trying to get angry
Where it's just funny to argue with him
And ur not like will
Like u don't get really angry or anything
Oliver ur not really fun to argue with
Eh
I'm just loafing around cuz I don't feel like sleeping yet
Nothing
Lol
That was the first and last time I think
It was on my end too last summer
Yeah see?
It was never gonna get to one on my end
It was just me poking him
And it never was an argument to begin with I don't think
I mean the guy I was poking just left
My agitated is more like faint annoyance at the smallest things
I would react the same way a few weeks ago
I used to be more irritable when I was more introverted
I think it's just me reverting to my old self
I was this way before the break too
Tho I don't think this is related to that
I have been getting more and more easily agitated for the past few weeks
I've never been in proper drama before
It's fun
There's no need for me to be a respectful person if I don't feel like it
Nah
Mmm
Ig I won't
How could I put it
But that second mode is like a
When ur in the first mode ur just a normal dude
So I try to lure it out of u
And I find that second mode really funny
Ur fine sometimes and sometimes u act like ur better than everyone
Is how ig I'd put my new discovery
I like pushing ppl when they act pretentious or snobbish
Ig that's how I'd put it
I wouldn't push u if I felt like u were acting normal
Tho I was a lot more antisocial back then
Gotta switch back to my old introvert self
Just gonna have to get used to it
I've been thinking about it for a while now anyways
No no
Ugh
I won't see her for...
That comment hurts
Lmao
It's fun so I'll keep pushing
Idk
So it's interesting?
I've never met someone like u before
Ur a special case ig
But not anyone else really
Ig I provoke u at ur expense
I just find their comfort zone
I don't do it at anyone's expense
Hmm?
Tho ig I'm coming from a biased position, from how much I like pushing
He doesn't aggressively push limits at all
He's willing to be flexible for friends if he's needed
That's the impression I get from him
For prem?
Maybe I should take the time to take a proper look at myself over the next few months
Hmm
Tho I change a bit to fit in just a little too
And I'm more the type to push that system until it suits me
Ur more the type to change urself to fit an existing system
Or maybe it's just that I like pushing boundaries more
Hmm
Tho idk if that's the right way to put it...
U care a lot more about ur friends than I do, ig?
Tho ig ur different from me
It's what I do
If u like talking about it just talk about it
Seems kinda unfair tho :/
Hmm
Hmm
Or maybe hollow ataraxia will be enough...
I'll need this series again once I'm done with heaven's feel...
Fate cooking is so nice
Seems unfair
Prem shouldn't have to stop talking about what he likes tho :/
But I will accept it
I don't understand it
I will accept ur genius
Tho u did explain it to me
I didn't even understand what the question meant lol.
That 12 question today
Oliver and will will prolly talk about Vim tho
Don't try to reinvent a chat u left
U have me talking about my random bs, abhishek posting songs and dumb questions from time to time, Chem, history, etc
Accessible conversations have never been what this chat is about lol
What does that even mean?
I like that
So passive aggressive
Lmao.
That's what I just did on the debate chat cuz I got pissed
Just mute the chat and hop off to watch some anime
That's what I'd do if I ever got agitated enough
Lmao
Just close the app
Not leave the chat
Self awareness?
It's not fun when it's in dms tho :(
I mean, u could just mute the chat and leave
Ur funny when ur pretentious
I mean I told u y I do it
Hehe
What's going on here?
Almost couldn't stop myself
That was close
Good lord
Phew I almost just spoiled a gigantic portion of my vn and a series of movies for myself
But no one else will know that
Yes
I'm gonna have to screen shot that
What
Um
Ur welcome
I had to scroll down pretty far into my archive to get that
Hold on
Wait
Oh oh
The prerequisite to applying is to give Ray a box of chocolates

I don't wanna use a messenger call
@Will Liang @pornhub PREMium r we calling with discord?
Gotem
Damn.
Y do they even have a smurf festival?
Didn't someone send that before?
I got one wrong today cuz I didn't read the whole questions -_-
I got 69% two nights ago
O lmao
Neat
So exactly the same as u
I got 73%
22 was a bit excessive imo
Well it's only 12 questions so that's neat
Rip
For the thing due tmr?
Wait what?
Gotem
That is how it works
Therefore it is bad
Bruh the joke doesn't make logical sense
Ez
Women r property so it doesn't take a person to put it in
Nah
Will do
I would if it was will
Do I get to choose which homie
O
Or does it mean something else
Does jammed up mean ur gonna get a dick up ur ass?
Explain it first
uwu
Tho tbf hardly a coherent thought passes through that desolate space
I cannot string those words together coherently within my mind
What does that mean
We meet again
Ah stomachache
Gotem
That's what she said
It is hard to misspell my name
Lmao
Music to the ears
Nice and easy to memorize
This is a good name
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Anaani Muss to pornhub PREMium.
Gotem
Premum
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Aadithyaa Sridharbaskari to Aditya.
Addittyya
@Will Liang

Jeanne of arc
Adittya
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
Not the best but it do be quality
Your name is quality
Stop right there
How
Get sniped
Yuri
Doridori something
I have a song with a similar title in my Playlist lol
Aside from emails
I don't think I've ever written anything to a teacher before
Ig I will have to recycle
Fuck I wanna post an anime meme but I don't have any in stock today
Gotem
Unlike ur mum
Hmm
Damn I'm starting to get a stomachache again

Gotem
Gotem
That's what she said
I'd forgotten about that
O yeah lmao

That was interesting
I made a triple noose out of shoelaces once

U cannot escape my prying eyes

Quidbit?
Lmao
I saw it and just thought u were copying abhishek again by saying weird stuff
Was this meant to be a slide?
I will resume tomorrow
OK this is enough for one day
Gotem
Ur mum is
Gotem
Ur mum
U know what is a slide
What a name
...
U almost got me there will
April fools!
From who?
I didn't think you'd know what sarcasm meant until the end of time lmao
That was quick
Did u catch it in Oz?


Will at this rate u will turn into me
Gotem
I got sniped
Fuck
Ur mum is on
More like
Will is on a roll today
Gotem
Gotem

Gotem
Ur mum
Guess what I made
U made that joke
Gotem
Got ur mum
Gotem, more like
Damn gotem
That is not today tho
One of these days I'm gonna get tired of making shitty ur mum jokes
Gotem
Ur mum
Judging from last summer lmao
Hey wait that's exactly what u don't know how to do!
Yesterday was a good day
I knew it was prolly his dad but I asked him who it was just so I could say "ur mum"
Yesterday prem's dad was in the background of the call
Gotem
Ur mum
I need answers cuz I am dum dum
I totally don't know
Who?
Ugh my nose kinda do be leaking today
Jus take it
It'd a compliment
Prem he means ur as strong as a bull
Lmao
What even is this sliding
Free speech
Hey
Damn I thought he was gonna ask prem to succ
Gotem
Ur mum
@Anaani Muss bow down to me
Well ig I'm sacred to prem
That's neat praise ig
Damn
Am I sacred to u?
And bulls r sacred to Hindus
Wait if I'm bullheaded
I'm sad now :(
Damn
Bullheaded?
Will is super smart /s
OK
Bruh lmao
That is how it works aadithyaa
Means it's sarcastic
Saying a sarcastic comment
No
U gotta lure it out with a white radish
Travel to the land of Oz and u will find it
I see u have not caught it
There is such a thing called sarcasm
...
I assume me?
?

I can't see ur messages
U don't exist
Nah prem u got shadowbanned
I am an offense to this man's intellect and existence it seems
O fuck I got a little oil on my desk
Either way is fine by me
Otherwise u seem fine
So I poke u into it if I can to entertain myself
When u try acting high and mighty
I just think ur funny
Aadithyaa I've got nothing against u
It's directed at me lol
I wonder if there r more rock rolling things on reddit today
That's a pretty good perk
Damn
Lmao
So I just did it again
And judging by that message u seem like ur pissed
I've done it in the past
I spend so much time giving my retardation to others, I could use a little from u
Exactly
Due to my immense privilege, I can afford this
So I want u to keep entertaining me
But ur funny
It doesn't
I just thought it'd be funny if it was
I didn't even click it
Damn lmao
@Aadithyaa Sridharbaskari keep going plz
It should've been a link that transferred u to Rick roll
Gj
Lmao
I'm too lazy to read that
Hmm
Lmao
I don't think aadithyaa understands the fact that his point doesn't matter
Feels nice
I usually nap at 5 for like 20, 30 minutes everyday now
I'll prolly nap at 5 or so
6 should be fine
Ye I'm getting pulled from my vn rn
Aight later tonight
I haven't even looked at it yet
I was gonna do it later tonight
O that thing
What outline thing?
What's this?
So I'm even with that guy
I have an advantage over the dumb bastard sitting next to me in apush tho
U have two
Which one
I'm watching anime rn to ensure that I will become more big brained
Some do it better, some do it worse
The point of life is to make it so ur kid has an advantage over the dumb bastard that lives next to u
Some dude from Austria came up with it
True egalitarianism
If everyone but u is dead, then ur not at an advantage
If we exterminate them then we won't be privelaged anymore
I agree with aadithyaa that we should not allow the poor to exist
I think that's the move guys
And make poor areas rich
So we can push the poor out with hyper inflation
Buy stuff at higher than market prices and jack up prices
We should all move to poor neighborhoods
I think I get what aadithyaa is saying
OK guys
For life too
U get free housing and food if u just murder ur family
U don't even need to go to college then
Ez
Bruh just murder ur family
Disgusting
Prem ur filthy rich and stealing from the poor by eating
Eating and using electricity
Fucking rich kid
Bruh prem pays to eat
Prolly gonna do it tonight
I just need to do some apush
Yo in down for that
Should I finish it or save it
I have a little rice left
Then I wouldn't even need to put in the minimal effort for cs
It'd be nice to have pass/fail
We're not talking about college classes Ethan
Two B's in physics really did me in

Cuz they can balance out my shitty sophomore grades

I kinda want letter grades too...
What's this for?
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
Bruh
Will
If u haven't noticed I don't usually care if anyone is reading what I say lmao
That is not a prereq to me talking about my stuff
And a ton of them r me getting murdered by what's technically my step half sister
The bad ends r where I die or fail
The visual novel I'm playing
Well technically Hercules
R me getting bashed in by a loli
A ton of the bad ends
Jesus
Very meaningful
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
Cmon now
Hey hey hey
Jeanne of arc
Lmao
I'm always off by like 0.03
Keep Jeanne
No
Phew
I thought I just unlocked a bad end
Fuck yeah
O I'm still alive
Me*
Fuck em
Ah fuck did I just die
World
So they better
I have only one subject test down rn lol
I have a feeling we can't retake...
I'm reading through all the bad ends and wow
Holy shit I dodged so many bullets in this visual novel
Well ig not unique cuz there r two other versions of her
She is different and unique
Nah
Santa lily
Jeanne
Nah
?
It's Jeanne

Jeanne of arc
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
The destiny subreddit is being not salty today
Huh
It was some shit
That place was
R/enoughinternet also got banned
Gotem
Ur mum
Those subreddits all got banned tho...
I was thinking NSFW like the old r/watchpeopledie type nsfw
Disappointing
Ima head out then
OK so this subreddit is basically just porn
OK this is pretty funny lmao
I just watched a guy filming porn eating a cake and giving it to one of the porn stars while they were at it
Goddammit
O ffs how much shit have I missed out on
I thought I turned my NSFW filter off
Wtf
Hold up
What do they usually post there...
I haven't went on that subreddit in a very long time
Lmao
Well fuck u
The anime subreddit isn't doing anything I think
I saw a few family guy memes
I miss all the hentai memes already :(
Lmao
I don't think pcmr is doing anything
Animemes is doing western cartoons for the day
Instead of with animemes
This year history memes swapped with prequel memes
It's really fun
They're doing subreddit balls for the day
Sadly I won't have any anime memes for the day :(
I like the new polandball April fools
Gotem
Haha April fools
Ur shoelaces r untied
Hey will
As usual
We will have proofreading ring
I am safe
Hehe
Uc don't count pe in uc gpa
Just not as useful
Not completely useless
I mean I'd rely more on my grades and essays to set me apart anyways
Ye
Hmm...
Should I just not submit my score
They're not gonna make one test more important
Bruh it's obviously gonna be both lmao
Maybe I just won't submit my score
O shit lol
I can tell u that
The three ppl she used r on there
Ye
Hmmm
Prem is simping for will
Can we say
Hmm

Today ima. Do a little history
Let's do it tmr
I just saw it posted
Yed
Or knew, I think the VPN we used might be down now
My mom knows how to do it from China tho
Tho I never bothered learning how to do it from within China since I could always just have the VPN downloaded before I go
I'm just saying it's ez to flip over lol
Ye no shit

Lmao
80% more of 0 is 0
Graydon
Damn lol
It's actually so ez to get over it tho it's a joke lmao
I could not flip back over the great firewall :(
I was trying to find a VPN to let me back into China in order to try out that anime website
Tho I've found a really good Chinese site for anime so ima try that out when I get back
So I binge read instead
My grandparents don't have great wifi as is and a VPN just slows it down even more
I usually just read when I'm in China
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
Good shit
Ppl r trying harder than ever to get past a censorship and trying to clown the govt lol
Mmhm
That message was retracted really quickly
The ccp told them to be thankful for govt management during the crisis lmao
Cuz a lot of ppl on China r pissed
The ccp has survived but maybe it'll be a little weakened
Lmao
Can't participate yet so it's whatever to me
Well I don't really care about the election much
Ye I just searched him up
Not for the US lol
I was talking about this
Andrew who?
Now is a good time
Buy up fallen stocks
Externally this is a bad time
Internally for China at least
I doubt anything serious will come about from this virus tho, politically speaking
Which is real nice
That rule is cracking a little rn
The ccp knows that stability is the foundation of its rule
If u try to compete with one of the big government companies, they just pull ur workforce right out from under u lmao
China is ruthlessly capitalistic lol
It's the type of thing I'd have expected out of the ccp Tbh
No one be buying cuz recession
There r auctions for antiques that r hella good in pricing rn lol
So ig I'm wrong
Well I will admit I don't enjoy following the news much anymore
The US Healthcare system has a lot to gain
Except Healthcare, ig
Cuz dying ppl aren't great for business
Even a conservative leadership wouldn't loosen restrictions and cause more deaths for business
I doubt that's ever gonna happen lmao
I mean the spanish flu, iirc, only lasted for a year or two right
Still unlikely imo
Yeah, but a full year and a half of this virus?
Aside from China, I assume the ccp is kinda hogging their test kits a bit just in case
And testing stuff is in short order rn everywhere
It's localized and hard to track unless if u get tons of testing stuff
There's no single faction for them to take down to stop the spreading
It's the part about them being ill equipped that makes them ill equipped
I doubt it's the western democracy part that makes them ill equipped
They seem to like their new president fine
But ik at least a little about South Korea
Lmao
I actually have no idea what Singapore is like as a political entity
South Korea
U don't need a dictatorship to be effective
Singapore and South Korea both did great
That took about half a year
China's already got it mostly under control
I doubt this will go for a year and a half tho...
With no closure and no send off
A random Thursday
Yeah that's prolly their last day at foothill lmao
Otherwise I just knew I was gonna be busy with college apps and stuff
I'll miss a few of them, kinda sucks
The only thing I thought about was how weird it'd be to not see any of the seniors ik anymore
I'm not looking forwards to sem 1, for obvious reasons
Well ig you've just stumbled on an amazing discovery
...
Seniors in novice lmao
And do novice
Prolly just gonna drag will to scu2 next year
I've been talking about it for a while now
Bruh lmao
But I still plan to help manage the club at tournaments
Tho I'm prolly gonna drag will to a few tournaments if I can just to have a good time
If I had plans to keep debating competitively I would still be with u lol
Bruh don't u remember what I said about stepping out?
Ur prolly just gonna face novices
U could prolly just copy a case from someone else
It does sound hella jank lol
Still thinks putin and Xi and Kim Jong Un r his friends tho, doesn't he?
U two could get a little practice in before next year
R u and Michael gonna join their online tournament thing?
We did
So I can just revert myself to my old state and I'm fine staying home alone
Ig I'm lucky cuz I used to be a complete introvert
Subha is not having a good time staying at home
Except for like Maduro ig
I mean Trump thinks everyone is his friend
But if he acts like a dumbass, ima laugh at him for being one
Yes yes ik, it's an act
Or, like, all of them
I mean a lot of western countries r enacting travel bans and stay at home orders...
I wonder y
It's like it suddenly became important to him
As soon as he caught it he's like "I don't like China now because they let the virus get out of hand"
What a dumbass
I saw boris Johnson lmao
Tho they r banning travel from foreign countries and loosening restrictions very slowly to try and prevent a second wave
They're fine, it's mostly over and done with in China for now
I'm just gonna go back to my anime until I sleep
Well at least ur fine
Smh
If I wasn't here it prolly wouldn't have been so bad, but I have family who only narrowly avoided it back in China
Well it's too late and I'm too tired to lecture u on it as I would my little cousin...
That was in seriously bad taste
Cmon
Asmi
...
The death rate for infected ppl is really low so most likely he's fine
Best of luck @Asmi Mukherjee
I was gonna do a shoelaces thing but now it's not appropriate anymore...
No one here is retarded enough to do a corona joke Oliver
Shit
Wait actually?
@Anaani Muss call?
Pog
...
@Anaani Muss call at 9 30?
Which is surprising since I always hated napping as a kid
It seems like I need my nap more than I need full 8 hours
Now at least
I usually get 7-8 hours of sleep and then 20 minutes of napping
Bruh lmao
So nice
A 4 or 5 o'clock nap
Ngl I like my days now
From a CA superintendent
Yall saw the news about how schools prolly aren't opening for the school year now right
I can clown myself
I've already accepted that fact
Ye ima get rejected
Gotem
Can't relate when u don't apply
Imagine getting rejected
Nut milk
Mmm
Gotem
Just like ur mum
Coronavirus did not reject the smurfs tho
Is this what I've been waiting for
U just didn't have the sheer brain power of bk
Ez
So I didn't get rejected
U can't get rejected if u don't apply
Ima eat
Aight
Prolly the reason for y I did better on semester finals than normal tests for a lot of elementary school...
Except for semester finals
I used to not really check on tests either
And I don't think that counts as checking
The only "double checking" I do is copying down my math hw
I never bother double checking hw lol
And then I'd be free for the rest of summer
Rough estimate
Math would take 5 days and literature like 7
Meaning it took the longest
The literature one was always the killer
English was like 80 but I finished that in one or two days l9l
English aside the last one I did was like 65 pages Chinese 70 math
I still remember grinding through those summer hw books
So ig I got myself to work real quick
I always pushed myself to finish a summers worth of hw in two weeks or a weekends five hours
Chinese education I suppose
Lmao
I'm in the same class
Yes ik
All I had planned to do tonight was go through more of my visual novel anyways
I'd prefer not to but if it's more convenient for u I'm fine with it
Tonight?
I do not have the brainpower to do compsci
Hey prem can we call Thursday night
Feels good
I have no hw due until Thursday

Indeed
Lmao
If he wanta to
Well we don't need a fourth
O aight
So Ethan prolly gonna join us
Buy one get one free
Ethan is kinda a package deal with will
We can have one more person
@Anaani Muss @Will Liang group
Aight bet
Gotta get optifine
Fucking closed the thing a minute in
I've tried it on my laptop before
No
But try saying that again after u get used to 144hz
It might not hurt for u
I mean
Fuck I've gotten too used to my monitor
My eyes
Ow Ow ow
The fps at the start of the vid
Gotem
Ur mum
Need I say it
Yes
Ez
Make them stop living by giving them the virus
Gn
Aight time to sleep
Well flat is justice
Kinda flatter tho
I usually fold it into a little burrito shape
Just kinda spread it over my bed some days so it doesn't look like a jumbled mess
I've stopped bothering to fold my blanket now cuz ik I'm gonna use it to nap or read in later
So I nap a little after lunch
But it seems that way my fuel runs out a little after lunch
I run on 7 hours of sleep a day normally
My naps don't usually go longer than like 20 minutes
And mute myself
No I just tell him ima to nap
But he wouldn't know cuz he was playing Mc or something in our vc while I was asleep
So I ask Brian if I actually tell asleep
Tho sometimes I wake up and don't know if I napped or not
It feels so nice to wake up from an afternoon nap in bed
I almost always take an afternoon nap now too
And wake up at 8 - 9 30
Nowadays my sleep schedule is somewhere between 12- 2 30
Usually run a little late for psych
Tho instead I've just chosen to wake up later
I wish I had the willpower to sleep earlier
I do that every other day lol
Lmao
I'm gonna sleep now ig
Y am I still awake
Yet ur still awake
Prem I thought u said waking up late was not the move
This is amazing
One of my favorite anime characters had a virtual tuber
Omai g
I'm gonna my pc that I hate it
Arizona State inStitute
Ima get into ASS
Ima tell myself that I don't care about Fulton's couch
Hey its not April fools yet
Ima tell myself I'll stop being lazy
Nah that's too much
I can already feel that some retard somewhere is gonna do a coronavirus prank
Lmao
That's y I sent the shoelaces shit
Borgar
So it's not as fun
Now he doesn't think I'm drunk
Nah
Lmao
I prolly would've sent him a message saying I loved him
If u said I was
O gdi
Say I just passed out
Then you'll die of starvation too
Or just be poor and live in India rn
Ez
Y commit suicide when u can just socially isolate urself until u starve to death
I use it to vc Brian a lot when I'm just chilling or gaming
Tho the vc is problematic sometimes
Discord is good
Gotem

Ur mum
The fact that I mentioned me asking her was what started this whole convo lol
Already did
So it'll have to wait until dagen says
I mean they're not in same classes tho lol
He did?
Lmao
Wat
Cuz I've never had a dagen discussion with prem before
If it can be in between periods tho I'd go with prem and someone else
Ye, him me and u
That's what I'm asking
Lmao
Not as in I've never talked to u in my life
In terms of dagen discussions
@Will Liang if no between classes then bet
I've never had a discussion with prem before
I asked if it could be in between classes just to see
I saw
So if he wore pants it would go under the palm and not on the fingers
The emoji hand has all five fingers above his face
As ordained by the emoji movie
The left is correct
Just be big brained
Neat
I'm spending more time reading than anything else now
Mmm
I'll keep rereading my book
Instead of visual novels
Actually
Don't remember jack about the right hand rule at this point
I had worksheets from last year that would be helpful but I threw those away
Or do I need visual novels
Do I need sleep
Now
Nice
Damn I got a 69% on bio assignment
Halp
Cs
Prem
I read so much over the summer
Around 3600 pages
Also reread both mistborn trilogies and read warbreaker
This summer I reread all three books in two weeks or so lol
Loved every moment of it
1200 pages each just about
Actual tomes
Mmhm
Which is quick considering I like rereading passages
I read the newest book in a week back in freshmen year lmao
It's sooooo fucking good
Stormlight actually slaps
I've got a bit to read but rn I'm stuck rereading
Or the librarian series
I haven't gotten to legion or skyward yet
Ay what books have u read?
If he had a signing thing anywhere near here I'd fucking go there on my feet if I had to
I'm literally a Sanderson fan girl
Mmm
Fate is great but Brandon sanderson is just
Bruh lmao
Said I didn't have a particular favorite book
I told her my threw favorite series
Sniped more like a ally penetrated
Gotem
Silver more like gay
Dagen asked me what my favorite book is lol
Silver is cap
Nah Bruh bronze is better than silver

Bro I'm finna become usaco bronze
India is not doing well
Uh

Asia has it controlled for the most part I think
It's just u
Fake numbers but it does seem like it's going down
Lmao
That shit was funny
I saw part of trumps speech today
I think he was like the NYC mayor or something
Some big govt dude said April and may r gonna be worse
I didn't have anything else from dagen of note so
Then I changed the names cuz I was too lazy to find anything else
I already put it in before I even realized it was group lol
And removed the names :)
I put the hale morality thing in
My rmp essays were whatever
My bio grade is stronk
Anthropology and evolutionary biology
Tho I did go for psych and humanities stuff
Hehe
I prolly have 0 chance
Turned it in last day
Ye lmao
Lmao
For rmp?
I had an alarm to wake up at 2 50 tho
Hey that's what I did
She won't mind
Now it says turned it late lmao
I just u unsubmitted to change one word
I'm big brain cuz anime
Anime is better than debate
Ye fax
Fucking sorcery
What the fuck
He doesn't even show up as having read
How did Kiran tag an emote to that
What the fuck
Wait
That is how it works

So I'll take off from ur doc for like 10, 20 minutes
Ima shower in a bit cuz I'm getting sleepy
Lmao
She's still under the impression that they're Ken burns documentaries ig
Ye lmao
Gotem
Watch as she gives everyone a C anyways
Shouldn't the first sentences be kinda like a ts

Snippy snipe
Flat is Justice changed the chat theme to Candy.

@Anaani Muss am done with urs
Yeye
So I couldn't look it up
The quote prem used was in the same chapter as one I used but I just didn't bother looking for it cuz I forgot the phrasing
Nah
Ye
Lol
That I was too lazy to look for myself
I stole one book quote
Prem I'm almost done with urs
Last game now
One more game
Ok
This gaming session is going really well
Huh
Gotem
Then prem
Actually ima play one more game
Damn gotem
Idk what they talking about
Ik about ur prom date
Ima go through prem rq
Bruh lmao
Not chem
Bk and date
What is this
Gimme 20
Stuff due for apush later this week
Mmm
And to proofread u two
All I have tonight is the cs thing
Ima take a quick break and game a bit first
Gotem
I'm ur mum
Hi dying
I'll finish eating in like 3 minutes
I'm eating dinner rn
Prem did u want me to proofread urs
Ray can into proofreading
Ay @Will Liang share

I leave so much careless small mistakes in there lmao
God I always need prem to proofread my docs
Gotem indeed
Get boolied
Haha
Will that's cuz ur a poopyhead
This do be straight cap
But ur a nihilist
Gotem
It's not discrimination if it's against non humans

That's what I like to hear
So it worked out
I found a shorter version of it that kinda says the same thing

And one from around 75%
2 from the first 4 minutes or so
Hey that's exactly what I did lmao
Nice
So if u gotta do it quick do it that way
Imo it's easiest to grab quotes from the beginning and end of a doc
Idk how much including book
6 in total
I structured this thing really weirdly tho lol
I randomly grabbed any quote I thought would fit from the book so I have a ton of book quotes
So 6 in total
I used 3 quotes for each doc
Doubt u need to
Idk anyone else tho
I did
2 pages
Tyvm
Prem read mine pl0z
Lmao

So just deny the suggestions and it'll go away lol
And it shows suggestions
U can make suggestions
@Anaani Muss @Will Liang pl0x proofread
Aight I've finished
There, fixed it
Gotem
Ur mum
It says paragraphed response so I figured I could have a little liberty with my structuring
Just paragraphs that r loosely strung together
I don't have any intro or anything
Second for second
One for first doc
I split the response in two
Second doc
I did
I haven't finished second one yet but it shouldn't take long
Proofread
Read mine plz
Prem
I didn't pick up any show until summer, and the first show I picked up during summer was an anime, and then I just kept watching anime
Lmao
So spring break of last year
I think that was... Hbo's Rome?
How long as it been since I watched a TV show with actual ppl?
...
I mean
Well
I want see
Ay prem share
Alright, finished first quote
Lmao
I liked that quote
Behind every body, there is a next of kin
I found a quote like that too
Mmm
So milage might vary
Will and prem watched them whole tho
I watched like 8 minutes in total
But...
I owe prem enough, and I don't mind putting u into my debt even more
I'm trying to decide rn whether I should offer to help u two find quotes
Hmm
Or maybe tmr...
I might run in a bit
1.15 seems fine for me
Wat?
?
Welp time to make this a coherent response
And when I have 3 I'm done
I just hear something I think I can spin and write it down
Cuz that's always where the Narrator tries to lure u in or draw some deep conclusion
The start and the end
The start of the doc is prolly the easiest to get quotes from
Which I doubt she does, but precautions never hurt anyone
That way it'll seem like I went through the whole thing to her if she keeps track at all
Like 3/4 into the doc
I just nab two quotes at the start of the doc and then skip soemwhere near the end to grab one more
Two times speed sounds so goofy
Lmao
Aight I'm done collecting quotes
One more quote needed and I can get to writing
Lmao
Aight I found two quotes in one minute of the legacies doc
OK time to speedrun quotes
Ugh
I'm too lazy to start the second doc...
Gg
3 documentaries
Bruh lmao
So I doubt she'd care
She said at least 2
I've got nothing to trade with
I only have three quotes
Well I don't care to go looking
O damn it
Tyvm
I could use that quote lol
It might be life and death, but it won't be real
Like the political elite removed from reality, the soldiers become detached from the war
No more face to face, just call in air strikes
It's a mechanized war with the humanity removed
Rip
Is this a challenge
But I'm only a minute in
Legacies looks like it might be a hard time
Gg
Lmao
I mean I'm not in ur class period so...
The guy sounds so goofy on x2 speed
Neither documentary is by Ken burns tho lmao
Before I get back to it
Now I'm just watching yt and chilling for a little
Fuck this
Started the second then was like
Only the first
The curse has been broken!
Oh my God
Oh
Ignored yet againn
He was playing Mc lmao
I was in a vc with Brian but we were both just chilling
Rip
I'm not sure exactly, wasn't concentrating the whole time
30-60
But I took like 30 minutes to write this
I only watched the documentary for like 5 minutes sure
I did not
For once I actually feel offended by something that should offend me
?
Hopefully I can find nice quotes quickly for this doc too
Nice
Do some other did
I thought u finished lol
O ur not done yet?
I finished the first one
Prem can u look at mine
Lmao
I like how u asked for it but ur not even looking at it now that I've shared it
I shared it u dingus
I just took the quotes and put a paragraph around them
It's not really structured as of now
Time to move on to second doc
Lmao
Done
Aight I watched like 6 minutes of the first doc
I'll share it with u and prem in a bit
Then I'll get a whole page for the first doc
Actually ima find one more quote
Lmao
This is enough for me I think
Only watched 6 minutes
Ima just grab two quotes from the first doc
Lmao
The first documentary isn't even burns
I'm gonna watch the first and the 9th
Lol
Is pretty good to use
One of the first lines of the first doc
Mmm
Don't u have to watch two?
Or documentaries in general
R u talking about this particular bunch?
I'll go find my own quotes
I won't take any
I really liked documentaries growing up
Hopefully they're good documentaries...
Gonna take a nap first so I don't fall asleep during the documentary
Whatever
I'll just do it myself later
Hmm
If will uses those quotes
O wait
Prem make doc and share plz
That'd be great
So no one else needs to watch
If someone can feed some quotes
Like how I did with the book
Can I just watch like half a documentary and answer the question with that?
How long does this take
Ima play another game then get to it ig
O shoot I gotta copy down my math hw
Linus noodle sauce
O it's just grading the frq
Prem plz
Apcs frq due tmr
Ugh
I've got a problem with it
5 times on my first sat
It happened to me like
Sounds nice
I've been playing this one Japanese song on a loop
One of them I got wrong cuz I read it wrong...
Finished a set of bio practice questions
I only just got out of bed like 15 minutes ago
Lmao
I don't think anyone in this chat has started
Who do u think I am
U mean documentaries?
Reflection?
You'd have to be dumb to not expect to get bombed if u shoot at American soldiers
If he was just there then guess not
If he shot a dude then he prolly knows to run
What's his name
Isn't this the sniper that shot
O
And then u get the shit bombed out of u
And the one for Americans is that nothing will happen for like 15 minutes after u shoot them
The jokes was about shooting at different nationalities
It's an old ww2 joke
It's well known that Americans call in airstrikes and mortar and shit lol
Y wouldn't he
What
Just run after u cap the man lol
He prolly got away
Nick big bad boolie
O well
Wdym

Idk, effect seems like a could have could not have
Lmao
Vincent said he wasn't asking for what we told him.
What're these about


As for including effect, I don't think it matters
Either one works
U can split strat or split meaning
Yes
Pos
R u transphobic will?
Gotem
Thy female father
More like.
Ur
I wouldn't bother making sense of what is and isn't made up if I were u

Am I cool now too?
I spent over two hours sleeping
If u lay ur eyes on a female individual u do be simping
That is how it do be
If u don't abuse women ur a simp
Hey
Imagine spending time on ur theses instead of just giving up
U rart
The opposite of a simp
Is like
A misogynist
Will
That's not a thing
U can't abuse property
Hey
Who is it
Was she a bitch tho?
I thought u said u weren't changing anything
Rip
I dislike yam
It's made of yam
O
I just know choco pie r great
Never tried one before
Idk
Heavenly
Mmm
Eating dates after making tea with them
These dates r great
It can't be that guys always outnumber girls cuz I'm pretty sure the school doesn't swing one way or another really
Personally
But I put it right above it
Not in the thesis
Art?
Gg
He prolly wants mass genocide against Pakistan or some shee
I always knew prem was racist af
Maybe for u
That's what she said
We all expected the F lmao
I didn't
Did u expect to get an A?
That works too
Or when u discover that cute anime girl ain't a girl
That's surreal
And it feels like it ain't real
Or the other way around
And then u get an A
I fucking failed that test, ima get an F
And ur like
Like have u ever been on a day where ur getting tests back for a class
Means it feels surreal
Surreal seeming news
Gotem
Unlike ur mums dick size
Gotem
Just like ur mum
Illusory
Numbers r illusory
Just like age, it is but a number
Get boolied
Gotem
Cuz it is will
It's gonna be doodoo either way tho
Nothing to worry about then
Aight tmr midnight
Wait I should finish the book first
Should I start the documentary one today
The one due today or tmr
Which one
Nice lmao
Gotem
Fucc ur mum

Gg
Lmao

Otherwise idk

Ez
Then u won't need to shoot urself
Sepukku

Your colonies gone
But am curious
It won't be me

The definition of tenacity
Yet he persists
The amount of times nick had ignored this man
I was enjoying a baked sweet potato earlier
4 hours?
Um
I'm woozy for having sat the past
O shoot
I'm dying
Wow
Standing up for the last two minutes tired me out
I too speak English, yes

And wanted to use more quotes so she doesn't smack me for it
I didn't even have that many ideas but I just felt like writing lol
Write however much u feel like
Lol
I'm sure it doesn't actually have to be super long...
Lmao
Bruh lmao

@Will Liang could pay off some debt ;)
But with cs
I shouldn't need any help with bio
Mmm
This is some stupid shit lol
Well we'll see what happens
Mmm
Don't even have to study for compsci or bio like I thought I might need to
Well this is great
How have I only just heard of it
What
What the fuck
https://palyvoice.com/155393/news/breaking-ap-exams-to-be-open-note/
Um
Aight it should be uploaded
But idk for school

Otherwise nah
I will eat it if u give me an actual potato
Surprised by a swimming pool tide
King of knights
Now it is Saber
So felt like changing it

The shaved cat is old
I've changed both my personal and school account pictures recently
Seibah
I just gotta go approve the suggestions later
Yeah I did
I thought I have u two the same mode
O
I'm pretty sure?
I thought so at least
I gave it to both of u
I don't even remember doing that lmao
Wait when did I put them in italics?
Can u change them for me 
Just copy paste into docs later
Bruh lmao
Hey have u shared urs with me yet?
Whatever works
I liked that quote
O ye
Which thumb thing?
Can't be grumpy when ur fucking dead
I remember writing a sentence to make it clear that my mind was in conflict with my gut feeling
Wait I thought I had a sentence that said that
It was hella stupid but I liked it a lot when it just popped out
Idk how I even came up with the stomachache thing Tbh
Huh, I thought you'd be more used to my dumb humor by now lol
Haha
Gotem
More like ur mum
Like the way I ended it?
Wdym abrupt?
Ye that was what I was going for
Like u know gut feeling
The incongruity between my mind and gut
That's what I was angling for
Mmhm
I liked it cuz it was hella stupid lol
Good way or bad way?
Wat

Now is prolly the perfect time to start building up the habit of reading before sleep again
Prolly
I'll prolly finish the book on these two days
Ironic since some of my songs r straight up epileptic
Lmao
Music gets me calmed down
I think I do better when I can listen to music
Tho my quality isn't very high when I'm forced to write an essay on the spot, it seems...
I'd like to think it's from practice in terms of the time I spent reading
Indian Civil War
I usually do everything in one night then make small edits for a while
I do work at the deadline or right after it for classes that don't matter so much to me tho
For major assignmentd
For dagen assignments I usually work on them over the last week for few days before deadline
I slack because I work quickly, not because I don't do work
I put in actual work too
Despite what it may seem like
Hey
So ima just keep doing it
Vague but whatever I'm doing has been working for a year now
My somehow means just continue doing what I always do
I'll pull it up somehow
Don't mind much
I was and am still prolly borderline
Just haven't gotten away from the anime and vn I'm addicted to rn...
Learning Chinese while also learning history or reading novels is gonna be great when I start doing it
So I kinda did waste my money lmao
Tho I can just use an online one more easily...
Well I bought my little dictionary for a reason
Tho it'll take a while to get going
At least I have productive things lined up whenever I get tired of being unproductive
Imagine being productive instead of loafing around all day
Close enough
Child buttcheek thrashing?
Cognitive behavioral therapy?
Isn't that the whole point of getting an education
O now im starving
I, too, communicate using words

Gl man
Fuck I was sniped
Usaco?
Ye
Hey will can u read my dagen thing
Time to get back to my visual novel
Phew
Finally done with the outline that was due 26 hours ago
I've still got like 90 pages left lmao
From Korea we get nice monitors and semiconductors and stuff
So we get neat robots
Yeah but they can make robots
India can produce fertilizer but that's about it
They're useful
They can make robots
Gotta enslave theirnpopulationn
Ye
Doing it to Korea or Japan would be bad cuz they matter
Attack a small and irrelevant tributary to make it better
Sounds good
Mmm
Which tributary?
We should make small countries more relevant by invading them

So I accidentally do that a ton
Double tap space bar is period
Yeet
Iirc
Tanked a shot and proceeded to make fun of his shooter during his speech
Roosevelt tho
Women are property
Hippity hoppity
Then u would agree that
If ur not a simp
Lol
I exploit Marty for being lazy and my math teacher for trusting his students
She's too nice
I usually do other hw in her class anyways and she doesn't mind
It is but rozelle doesn't care
My tea hers did pile on work, but I'd have no problems if I didn't slack off for three days straight before doing any of my work
Which is half true
Gonna tell her my teachers piled on work so I didn't quite have the time
I can get it done by like 5 but I just ain't feeling it
Lmao
I have 2.5 pages done so far
Ik
Don't feel like doing them rn...
Along with lecture notes
If I turn in my psych outline tmr
How many points do u think I'll lose
Kiran
Ketamine, will needs
Smh
Such a clown, will is
Imagine not being done with the writing task
Ur more of a clown than I am will
So don't complain when I clown u for being behind me
U always clown me for chilling
Will is a clown
Smh
Imagine being so unproductive that u haven't finished yet
Gotem
But because I'm better
I'm further ahead not because I did more work
Meaning I put less work in
I did more in less time
I agree

Do whatever then ig
Well idk, lipman did.
O she doesn't?
Smh
...
Scroll down
Bruh
What
Bruh there r spaces below the chart lmao.
But I finished the assignment.
I'm still only a little more than halfway done
No
But I like it the way it is
Could cut a lot out
I didn't need so much stuff in there either
Felt like it
Idk
?

Aight
Is the psych outline still 7 pages?
Welp, done with bio
Nicd
China getting hit with second virus wave now
Ah
If they just pushed back cuz coronavirus I'd have thought that was normal.
The fact that sip changed their minds is what made me think not enough applicants
Did they say they wouldn't push back?
Omai
Ez money
So I'm prolly gonna get it
Ye exactly
Lmao.
I assume they didn't have enough applicants
Sip said they wouldn't push due dates for applications back but then they did
Ikik
No ur teacher fills out ur application for u and u write the teacher rec letters
U dud
Not the application
The teacher rec letters
It was originally due today
They extended deadlines I thought
I remember for rmp there was
Is there any way to check
SIP
Mmm
should I email rozelle and Fulton just to make sure they finished my rec letters
Exactly
Which only proves the point that I'm a mad capper
Ur just so dumb u can't remember
No I have
Yeah, including that one time I said u were smart
What're gonna do, flame my bad jokes for nOt mAKinG LogICaL seNsE
I'm just trying to make a joke
I don't exactly care lmao
I haven't skipped math assignments in math tho
Falling to new levels of degeneracy and laziness
How to u feel prem
Ur officially less productive than me now
So
I haven't skipped any assignments outside of math
Mmm
Well look at it whenever
Idk
Looks like I'll have to unsubmit
I already turned it in tho
Mmm
Tbh I really didn't care about the other two parts, i just wanted u to read #3 to see if it was fine
I wanted u to read that asap lol
O the question 3
Rhetoric stuff?
After which I'll cool off with a visual novel for a while
So I'll be working until like 5
Today I've got my work all piled up
I'll prolly read it tmr
Unsustainable
Pollute*
Ur literally asking us to kill trees for nothing and polite
Smh
That's not environmentally friendly will
Like print one out and burn it?

I've got plenty of time
Hmm
Case study due 1pm
Well now I'm done with math
Ez

Ima get it done, no worries
@Will Liang @Anaani Muss so unproductive, smh
Ye
I also need to copy down the math hw for today
Tho I can prolly turn it in an hour late and be fine
Speed run time
Ye
Just gotta do bio case study
Not great but whatever
95
So I'm not doing it
First week optional
And something else that slips my mind rn...
A case study
Now I've just got a psych outline/lecture notes
Two weeks ago?
When else
Last night
Yup
You've got nothing on me now
I finished both
How?
Imagine not already being done with the reading task
So wdym new
Isn't that due like Monday
I'm so confused
But what about the documentary thing
The documentary thing?
I need to buy a new chair with how much I'm sitting...
https://youtu.be/SLm4qzQPelQ

Don't question it
That voice acting was some next level shit
And the grandma
The boomer store owner
The mom
The little brother
The dude
The tsundere high school girl
Like she was the little girl
This morning I found a video of some Japanese VA voicing a whole fucking cast
I know all sorts of things
It's not hard info to get ahold of
?
I assumed she just had an audio overlay
Idk
Vocaloids
There's also singing bots
U can see voice modifier
If u compare it to usual
https://youtu.be/7D9HPeg3kr0
Will is sped so he doesn't understand
Damn gotem
Speedwagon from jojos
On who's back
Oumae kumiko from hibike
Don't get her mixed up with red Saber or Saber of red
As in artoria
Saber from fate
U can watch those
I have characters I think r great
Bk prolly has one
I don't have one tho
U better make it better than all the existing ones somehow
Funniest shit lmao
Yoda asmr

Kizuna ai
Just look at this
There is a real person behind it
Lmao
Project melody is a cam girl btw
https://youtu.be/wOjcOIYGaOc
And they can change their voice too
But it's a cg overlay
Like there's a real person operating
It's an artificial streamer
No
?
?
Homogay
He used the orbs to grant his thicc wish
Tho ig he did have to time travel back
More just use it to save both of them
Not really time travel
Fulfills someone's wish/happiness
Mmhm
U actually have to do a little digging at the lore behind it to fully appreciate it
Tho they could've handled the ending a little better, needed a little more world building to feel less shoehorned
Most of it feels so natural
That show just has a way with things
That scene and the train scene afterwards
I don't think it is but I can't be sure
Idk if it's the same field
It's time for a rewatch
Ye
I'm definitely gonna have to rewatch now
Fuck I forgot the name of the girl
When the girl is looking for her toy
The other field
No not that field
I'm tempted to get vr just so I can play some beat Saber  lol
Not alynx
Half life alyx
That's what I do half the time anyways
I'd be happy to rattle on to a wall lol
U think I care
Haven't seen a scene so powerful
The field scene
Bruh the fucking field in clannad
Try a no cry challenge and fail miserably
But I might just go for round two
Anohana was enough for now
I've been avoiding it cuz I don't want actual emotional torture
I might just rewatch clannad
Ya know what
Wait
No plz
Omg the dango
This is ptsd inducing
It's all fucking clannad
Harvard has an anime club
Oml
Ima need u to hold on to that thought
Bruh lmao
Yes or no tho
Close enough
Did he ever get a date with any of the twelve girls he liked?
Alex high key a simp lol
Lectures aren't fun if I can't dick around with friends while half listening
What r u face-palming for?
My outlines gonna end up being 5.5 pages lol
So close to finishing but I don't feel like it...
It's genuinely annoying...
Boo hoo indeed
Yup
So ig it's worth it
But that saves me at least an hour worth of lectures
This is annoying cuz I'm spending more time on the outline than I otherwise would
Lmao
And passing it off as lecture notes
And how I'm just writing extra on the outline
Did u not see me say that I'm not using his lectures
Will r u rart
Wait
Idc
Like u physically can't open them?
Wdym they don't work?
Ima prolly read his slides later tho
Can't relate
Imagine taking lecture notes
U cam bless them with ur excellent taste
So is everyone around u
If ur listening to something
The power of open back headphones
Ye
I'll have to choose something good for the trip
Or maybe read Manga or books
When yall busy debating I'll watch anime while speccing
And try new restaurants
But I'm happy to tag along
Graydon would go with Michael
I can hear stuff clearly from the other side of the room lol
Speakers
And boom
I just turn the gain on on my amp
If I don't want to wear them
Open back headphones so nice

Hmm
And one case study
One outline

But I can't cut it
Mine is too long

Something along those lines I think

Is this the web quest?
Wait

Just for writing excessively
I'm pretty sure u won't get more points
Bruh what
O
The call ended.
Flat is Justice joined the call.
Flat is Justice started a call.
He fixed my grade
93.2
We only have a few chapters left
If it's not that much I'll just take the hit
How much do u suppose he'll grade lecture notes as
Hmm
Mine is gonna be like 1/4 at most
When did he say that
Wait what the fuck
And it's not u
One of us is only gonna take like 20 minutes doing notes
Ez
Write it down and move on
The title
Idc what he says
Just hot that down
Yeah
That's what ima do
Ur good
If u can write down some info from the slides
Yeah but all u need r notes
Y r u guys listening if he has slides
He has slides
Wait
Double or quadruple speed or something and just occasionally jot down stuff
That's what I'd do
Can u not play audio at double speed?
Can someone transcribe plz
And send us all the transcriptions
Do it plz
Rip
O rip
My bios got corrupted the last time power went out and I had to flash it again
Might just be ur bios
My battery bank is low
Oh fuck
Should be fine reading for all of tmr if need be
Well at least i was on a reread for one of my favorite series
And I just lost that
The one thing I needed to get through isolation was my pc setup
Can't even fucking listen to music using my headphone setup
Can't get to my anime
I can't get to my Manga
Where I live
Is so fucking bad
My data
FUCK
I was just starting a new show
Fuck
Yup
Now what next
Fuck
That was a great read
Well
I'm never getting into Naruto tho
Nice
All is at it should be
Flat is Justice set your nickname to Age is just a number.
Hmm
Will be a pedo?
Take notes on that prophecy guys
And in the future, there's probably going to be a bad earthquake somewhere on earth that will cause lost of damage
That will happen this year
Something bad
There's probably gonna be
Guys
That's racist
Fucking insane
Ikr
Blows my mind
Can't believe they fucking predicted the coronavirus man
Bruh someone said something about a plague sometime in the future at some point in history
Holy fuck this story is getting good
Will 

Amazing
We still clown him regularly
Even tho he isn't here
It even has dlc
Play hentai area 51

Gotem

Lol
Where is that?
Nah prem is just racist af
Will Liang and that time he was asked about Helen Keller
Not a seasonal watcher tbh
I've got like 30 shows I'll prolly watch before I get to in spectre
Cuz I've started digging through Manga
I might end up reading it before I watch lol
It's in my watch list
Gotem
A lot of coronavirus patients
U know what isn't doctored?
Will is mad capper
Damn am starving
Kyoto is tiny lol
Damn London population isn't that big either
Lmao
I wouldn't have considered tokyo a big city
O shit
I just judge city sizes by how many ppl there r lol
Idk what ur talking about with proportions
I mean just judging by my standards
That's interesting
It has less ppl than Hangzhou, which I see as medium size
I would've considered it a medium sized city
Lol
I wouldn't have considered NYC as a big city
By population
Huh
O
But a small/medium city like Berkeley is neat
That's a bit much
Like Beijing or shanghai
Unless if it's a big city
So it's nice and comfy
Like the city feels more lived in
Just lively
Not social life
So just don't die
Sure but if u don't get murdered ur fine
But either case I'll stay in my dorm like 90% of the time
Cities r more lively tho
I don't really care where I live for college
Felt at home
Reminded me a little of China
I didn't mind the city
I actually kinda liked the Berkeley environment ngl
Ucla campus very nice
Mmm
Not nize
Ucsb campus nice tho
I'd be happy with uiuc
#7
Uiuc psych pretty solid
Ucb>stanford
This do be the dunning Kruger affect

Prolly to sleep later tmr

Lost to boss baby
Both silent voice and your name
Ye
But best movie
Lost to boss baby at Oscar's
Silent voice best movie
Yes
Cap
Nah
Ur opinion is invalid
We don't like abhisheks around here
Sustenance is secondary to anime
Coding is secondary
U must
Watch the anime
Nah just use scratch

@Kiran Suresh start with violet evergarden when u want
Will hmm?
The government put Ethan there to discover dagens techniques
Lmao
Stationed
Back to Manga
Aight I'm tired of gaming
It is the way the essay is
Sometimes true is a little vague but it's whatever
Your lie in april
O yeah
Hmm
I don't think I told u to watch k on
Silent voice is amazing

Those r the two I remember
Anohana
Violet evergarden
Or nein
Have u started watching the shows yet
Kiran
We don't like abhisheks around here
Negative
Fs
No it's real
I just stare at another
Rn if I'm tired of staring at one screen
No cap
Better stop using my screens now
That makes perfect sense
Ah yes
I can offer moral encouragement for free
At least a B
Disgusting
U heathen
No
Fate chibi is all there is
Fate chibi is all I need
The war crimes type

Should I start gaming
Hmm
Doodoo experience

Yes
U tard
Will
...
I used coronavirus lol
Ye
Flex
It seems fine
Mmhm
From mlk
Lol
At least something similar
We had that as an essay prompt before
O wait
Lmao
Press X to doubt
Bruh lmao
"my A in dagen"
Well guess I'm going to jail now
So ig I searched one thing up
Cuz I was tired of saying history
Actually I did search up synonym for history
I didn't do any googling and neither should u
If u knew it before sure
Don't use it if u just searched it up
Lmao
Bruh what
Wait did u just search it up?
Just do it
Said it's partially true for ancient history and false for modern history
So I split it into modern and ancient history
My truism was about history
I just have two cases
Ye
Neither does a truism
Truman does not always tell the truth
Lmao.
No
Can't u just say is false
Pretty much what I said
One partially true and one false
I gave two cases
Submitted too
First time I've seriously used my brain in a while
My head is exhausted
Wait fuck I didn't finish my laundry
Maybe I'll go back to my nap...
Strange argument
Lmao
Ima just turn it in
I've proofread enough
Actually
Gonna read over one more time
Not turning it in yet
Donezo
Perfectly one page
Alright
It's just a solid sheet of essay text
Lol
I don't have a header
Aight time to write outro
Actually ig it should be be it for better or worse
Whether is better ye
Not for the better or worse
For better or worse
And it's supposed to be
Ur supposed to write albeit
Not be it
Albeit
Then it goes in
Then prolly proofread one last time
Aight time to write outro
Dumbass
Cuz he doesn't want u to know the name
Eleanor bRoosevelt
The name is censored for a reason lol
Hella mini
Cut intro down to 3 lines lol
Just need to write outro now
What is this
Now I've got 4 lines left for outro
Cut my intro down to three lines
Mmm
And that's it for proofreading the two bp
Wish I could proofread and alter in class essays like this too
I spent a lot of time proofreading lol
I can squeeze a conclusion into three lines, prolly
3 lines left on page
I finished 2nd bp
But I cut down like 5 lines to be more concise
I can add on a little filler if I wanted to
Lmao
Mmm
V nice
Looks like I'll have like 4-5 lines to spare
So the limit is one page no spaces right?
He always sleeps with his eyes open lol
I don't remember it very clearly now
Idk, maybe
His soldiers just hated him for being a dick
It wasn't that his soldiers refused to drink
He got fucked cuz he was being a drunk and beating everyone up
Smh
Such cheese
...
To begin with
And the novel isn't very historic
Will u can't just misrepresent history lol
Bp2 should be easier to write
Mmm
Just finished bp1
But he was happy with his power and money
Well yeah no shit ur not happy when ur God-son stabs u to death
I mean he seemed pretty happy
Lmao
How r u gonna use three kingdoms for money
Lmao
U tard
No it's actual history
That's included from Shakespeare but it's historic
No that's history
They tried to make a temple his pier lol
Loved him to death
And the Roman's were very happy
Equivalent to three times a soldier's monthly wages
He gave Romans hella money when he died
Cesar's will
Talk about Rome
Ye
I'd have quantified it
R u supporting it?
I mean u can do whatever u want really, it's not a set bar
What is urs?
Try to use historic
2 today
1 historic
I use 1 lit
Lmao
Mmm
A book
Do I italisize three kingdoms?
But dagen despises them
I like them
Dagen despises hypothetical
Never use hypotheticals
Don't use a hypothetical
I usually do 4
4*
Ik prolly doing 5 paragraph
But it's not a req
Yes ofc
Lol
So u don't even necessarily need literature
And it says and/or
Idk man
I sense u might be
R u retarded will

This is gonna be a good time
Modern China and Russia
Three kingdoms
Gonna use ancient Rome
Victors
Mine is history is written by the Victor's
What do I want to use as examples...
Hmm
Bruh
Damn lmao
Wait
Let's see who finishes first
Hey will
I like those socks
But rn my priority is to find my socks
This is gonna be ez clap
I have mine already
Ima go look for my socks
Did I just lose my socks
Fuck

Now I feel awake
Good thing I napped
I was reading but decided to nap cuz I was tired
I could nap for a little more...
Mmm
Just woke up from a nap
Ah
I could use more Sanderson books...
?
But more homogeneous and crazy
I find it to just be a variation of Chinese culture
Japanese culture is prolly the culture I'm least interested in Tbh lol
I just think they write good stuff
Their language and culture aren't very interesting to me
Because I've got no interest in learning Japanese
I occasionally read Japanese Kanji like it's Chinese to figure out a rough meaning lol
Or learn the traditional forms
Sometimes I can pick up new words
Chinese subs means subtitles
I do
Lmao
Like I can't exactly learn a skill related to neurology or anything
Psychology stuff
I intermittently watch stuff with Chinese subs to learn a little
I am picking up more Chinese here and there tho
I'm not interested in learning Japanese
No
Lol
And the only things I find interesting aren't exactly accessible to me except through videos and maybe some articles
Not gonna pick up a skill until I find something interesting I want to learn
That's close enough
I mean I'm grinding through anime and Manga
I do enjoy it when I screw another player over in a pvp match
And also fuck ppl over ig
I just wanna grind for something
Idc
Don't ask me
Idk
But I do it anyways
I get frustrated sometimes lol
It's not exactly fun
I genuinely don't really care about anything else
Maybe 95%
Lol
Like grinding constitutes 90% of what makes a game worth playing to me
It's all I care about
Like for a special gun or something
Grinding in a game
Like some characters could be neat but I could do without
Lol
I don't give a shit about anything in games outside of grinding
O it's kinda different for games tho
It doesn't really matter if I know every beat of a story, I just want to be there with those characters
That's prolly y I reread stuff so much
Hmm
To me a show or a book is nothing if it doesn't have neat characters
Just don't like it
I don't hate it
Took a little self assessment for me to realize that I actually hated plot focused stuff
Just took me a little anime to realize that I actually don't give a shit about plot most of the time
I used to think plot was pretty important
Mmm
Some ppl say it doesn't have a plot but that's not true either
One of my favorite shows has a plot that's so slow that u don't notice it being there until the end lol
Plot doesn't really matter to me
I mean I do care more about characters
Mmm
That book didn't stick with me very well
So I can't really say how much they mattered
I don't really remember the sex scenes tho
Who u fuck is also pretty meaningful
Yeah but that shows how she was kinda getting back into her old life ig
Bruh lmao
Can't even remember that
Ifemelu had a husband?
Nah they ain't 2d
I think it did
How she saw herself and saw the ppl around her
It played a big part in her character development
Personal life is just as important as ideology when u want to make a complex character
So it should be emphasized accordingly
It's important to her
I mean
It's just part of the character's life
What's bad about a book having erotica parts?

Superintendent?

Hey prem can u read my questions thing
Imagine using ur private email for school stuff
I don't need to do everything to help
It is his assignment
I'm prolly gonna go nap sometime later
Just that I'm too lazy to fix
It's not that I don't know how to fix

I was always his superior
Mmhm
Ye
The way I word stuff just changes randomly half the time and idk y...
Has my wording improved again for no reason
I made big brain wording edit

I got it
I don't see it yet for some reason
What's the doc called will
Just sleep deprive urself until ur body is forced to wake up later
Then I start working if I have any work
And then I watch anime or read stuff until about 11
And I stay in bed for 30-50 minutes after waking up
I wake up around 7-9
Hey u two read my precis too
Cuz when I want to sleep in I close my blinds to stop the sun from waking me up
Tho I've been thinking of waking earlier so my plants can get more sun
So I don't mind
But I'm unproductive either way
My sleep schedule has gotten sporadic
Mmm
I see ur sleep schedule has been obliterated
U usually sleep early and wake up early
Huh
The things they carried questions
Prem proofread?
Finally done copy pasting
Such as binge reading this Manga
I've got more important things than math to do
I can't afford to lose those few minutes
Yeha but then I can't copy paste
Can't even copy paste the graphs
Goddammit
Tedious
Is so
Copy pasting math hw answers and editing slightly so my teacher can't tell
Those take less time and less thinking
Hopefully it's argument or synthesis
Ah
I won't finish by tmr I don't think
No
Gotta line something up to fill it
Fucking hate that empty feeling
Is the emotional fallout when I finish this
Atm
For the foreseeable future
The biggest problem in my life
This Manga is so good
Fuck
Ima do my outlines tmr
That's really annoying
A description of the visual and a quote from the film
Goddammit
I don't want to watch a damn film
Give me something to read
I fucking hate it
Wow
Um
The fuck
O
So I actually need ppl to look over them to make sure
I don't trust myself with those
Mine is all ready aside from the theses and ts
Lol
I thought u weren't done
But I don't want to spend several days on one document just editing lol
Unless if something wrong is found by someone else, then I go for another session
I just sit down for one session and edit everything usually
Don't even need to read the whole book to finish the assignment
Lol
U could actually finish the whole assignment when u finish the song Tra bong chapter
So idk how long it'll end up taking me
Cuz I like getting the wording just right
Cuz I usually spend a lot more time editing than anything else
So the time will grow
But I'll have to look over it and edit later
I just wrote the first question in one go in about 15 minutes lol
O rip
Did it take u longer?
What
Yeah about 1.5-2 hours prolly
Actually
Like 2-3 hours
It took a pretty while
I'll have to look over it again after peer editing but otherwise I'm done
I finished half of it but I finished the assignment for it
Feeling kinda productive rn tho so might just go and do outlines
Well after that I'll be done with everything dagen for the week
Aight I just shared precis
To shift it a day or something
Yall could try asking her
And do outlines
I was gonna binge watch shit tmr
Very inconvenient tho...
Shouldn't be that surprising
I mean it makes sense that she's doing it
Yall just saw what she posted?
Fuck
We have writing assignment tmr
Ah
Will share precis in a bit when I finish
Just finished article
Haha
I have stolen the funny
I stole prems joke and named my precis purple precis
And then I can read the book at my own pace
Might as well
I think ima do the precis rn
Rip
I prolly won't look at any of it again until u two do
Tell me when u two look at it
Well I shared it with u and will
One from lime lave 57
Two from first 12 pages
Only used three quotes
Lmao
The first quarter of the book
My evidence for #1 is all from like
If u want to take a look or want me to look at urs
I have finished the assignment
@Anaani Muss
And u inhale
Just has to get into the air
Doesn't have to be in ur face...
U prolly have the virus
So if someone is close enough to get to ur neck and lick it
Being within 6 feet of someone means u could get the virus
None know its inner workings
Will's mind is a mysterious place
Idk mam
U dumbass
...
Will really do be flexing here
Gotem
Ur mum
Yesterday
It was due
Nice
No oppression
This is suppression
No
Yesterday
Me neither
Yesterday
Yesterday
What

Yesterday
Pog

She said yesterday
Yesterday
And I liked a passage from it
I chose the third chapter for #3 because I just wanted to get it over with
I'm halfway in the book
No with the doc
Just feeling like finishing it rn
I mean I'm almost done already
Then finish the book at my own pace
I kinda do wanna just write the damn thing so I don't have to worry about it anymore
Mmm
Where he talks about the guy he killed
Ambush
I just got to it
I haven't read the chapter yet
Idk
Style
Would she think anything about how my whole thing will have no info from the latter half of the book
Did u use info from later paragraphs in #1
Wait @Anaani Muss
Tho actually I do have more than enough quotes already...
I could just finish #1 rn but I should prolly finish the book before I do that right
I've finished #3
Phew
Ima do it tmr night
I used illusory in a TS
hmm
actually...
i dont wanna reread the chapter to find stuff to use
yeah fuck it ima just delete the war stories chapter
idk man, i just remember it that way
i usually dont mind spoilers
i dont read or watch stuff for plot
i dont really
a bit of a bother to redo it from the ground up
maybe i'll just delete it
i kinda dont feel like changing this thesis/TS
ugh
i clearly remember seeing a message about him dying before i started reading
someone spoiled kiowa last night somewhere
well idk
im definetly not remember wrong
ray remembers too
instead of just making fun of u for being a dick
if i didnt id actually be annoyed
good thing i dont care about plot
but still
maybe it wasnt u two
last night i saw one of u say rip kiowa or some shit like that
lmao
maybe dont discuss it on a server full of ppl who havent read the book yet
so ig its a little late to complain now
i mean i already saw u guys spoil his death last night before i even started fucking reading...
dickbag
also thanks for spoilers
yeah i havent seen that one yet
the star shaped hole is man i killed
the war story chapter also has lemon
and im not changing them
i wrote them out like an hour ago
i used those quotes for my #3
i used the same shit as u lmao
@Will Liang we get it
gdi
aight ima change this then
rip
like did she specifically say it was because of that
was it because u talked about his content?
i can't remember much from this chapter now tho so ima have to look through it a little...
and then do second TS about his wording in narration
then i prolly should combine these two
hmm
o wat
i just didnt want to stick the word anecdote in there
in other words, anecdotes
rhetorical choices include what u decide to talk about
and then make a new one about his narration
whether i should just combine these two TS
i cant decide
halp
Sanders tale shows how war twists reality and the mind, altering facts and sensations to create a fake reality.
The first-hand recount of Lemons death is used to illustrate the amoral, dreamlike qualities of war-time memories.
do these TS's go fine with this thesis?
OBrien illustrates the meaningless, ungrounded nature of war stories through personal experience and description.
Will is a clown yet again
I have not read that chapter yet
This is a different conflict
O icic
Dumbo
The author
I mean for my first set of TS I didn't talk about any specific rhetorical term at all
Everything is rhetoric if u look at it right
Just copy paste part of my #2
Lmao
If I want I could just do the song Tra bong one
Idk what my last one will be
I chose that one and the dead dude one to do
Just know the name of it
Idk which it is
How to tell a war story
I feel like that shouldn't be a problem but idk
Just talked about the war stories he himself recounted
I chose the war stories chapter and just didn't talk about his personal commentary
Idk
I'm slightly worried my ts stuff for the first chapter I chose is kinda
Lol
O I thought he meant he only needed to write ts for the last question and not provide anything else for that question
Otherwise you'll end up like me
U can't be lazy Ethan
No
Dude just read the instructions...
And it can just be something about lost love
If u want gender could just not matter
It's just how I saw the chapter
Bruh
That's what I made mine all about
That's what I wrote
War doesn't have a gender and that gives the men the big scare
Lmao
It says u do
I just decided to do question 3 as soon as I finish a chapter I want to use
I'm only halfway through the book lol
Can u read over my ts's rn?

What?
Wanna make sure my topic sentences work out
@Will Liang peer edit?
This book is neat
Aside from number 1,which I haven't answered yet
Halfway through the book but just need one more chapter and I'm done
Bruh lmao
This is the first time I've ever come across this
What is this
https://youtu.be/zvq9r6R6QAY
Lmao
U can kinda just reuse question 2
For question 3
What question r u doing?
That's what she said
Will just use critique
I've got more than enough to do question 1 rn but I don't want to
I just wanted to do question 2 right after the chapter
No
Just say critique
Berate is definitely not more mellow
I wrote a lot to answer question 2
Huh
Icic
I'm confused
R u talking about
What
That was a good chapter
Just finished the song Tra bong chapter
Cool
OK so tmr at midnight
Today or tmr at midnight?
The audience is human beings
Then tmr it is
O
Damn I'll have to do it soon then
Today at midnight?
Tmr at 5pm?
When is this due?
To write an article
Rip
Bruh

Bruh how tho
So when I send it it means I agree to something
I just use the emote there as a thumb even when it's not a thumb
I mean... He's not wrong lol
I mean it's literally a summary except the structure is laid out for u

Should take like 5 minutes to write once u read it and sort out what u think

I'm sure it'll go down fine
Take a picture of a spread out anus and call it modern art
Anything is modern art really
That was modern art
That banana taped to a wall
I mean
Yale is safety
Yup
Stanford safety man
I already know I'm the best
I don't need to feel better
Well in either case I'm not doing anything
There's a link?
Lmao
How do u mess up so badly
But apparently I'm supposed to use my student id
The fucking login says "email"
Lmao
Is so stupid and broken
This website
...
I still remember when they told prem to be tech support lol
That's where it's at
Epic Bible College
Bruh Stanford is my backup
If u apply you'll get in fs
Harvard accepts everyone man
Yeah

It*
What r they gonna do, expell u for not doing 9t?
Yeah I'm not doing it
That can't be Oliver
This sentence does not have proper punctuation
Who is this?
What the fuck
Wait
Bruh lmao
I was reading but then took a half hour nap lol
I wanna read Manga for a little so ig I'll break until 2 30 or so
Slow progress today
I've only read a third of the book so far
Or maybe ur just racist asf
U got caught
But since the key term is nibb
Maybe u just said nibble
Let's Lynch him for being racist
Damn
Nib
What about
I do not swear as much as vulgar ppl like @Kiran Suresh
I am relatively pure and innocent
See
Didn't see that coming
Damn
Lmao
He has less than half my word count but only 47 less
Proportionally tho abhishek is #1
Haha
I'm still #1 for the dirty F word
Lol
I used to say fk to get past censors in games.
What a surprise
This shitty fucking app can't handle single characters it seems
Graydon ur breaking messenger
Lol
When I was active on discord I was usually near the top for messages in every server I was in as well
No one is ever gonna surpass me
At least it looks that way
Lmao my message count is more than everyone beneath bk combined
I'm too powerful for the rest of yall
Go back to the days where we just grunted and shit
Words should be abolished as a social construct
So both ungendered and gendered words r vulgar and offensive since they're gendered
If a word is ungendered, it is gendered because in order to say "ungendered" you must first sya "gendered"
Therefore it is evil
It fuels the social concept known as gender
Gendered is a gendered word because it's literally gendered
Meant is a gendered word
It's ment
If u take out that A
Meant
Female is also a gendered word
The concept of women is gendered because female is a gender
The word woman is gendered because man is part of the word
Gerperson
Ima keep it as is for now
Maybe later
It's buried too far down now tho
I had another edited version of this photo
Yes
My pfp rn
Hasn't been that for a while
Not my username anymore lol
Lemme find my current pfp real quick
And my name
I change my pfp on discord every once in a while

So
Even my stick figures look second rate
Lmao
I wish I could
It feels nice to change wallpapers every once in a while
Found a new wallpaper
Discord never has any problems like this
Idk y messenger is such a shitty chat app...
Yeah that's prolly y
Oreo?
What version of Android is the v30 on rn?
Prolly cuz ur phone is older or running an older version of Android
What do u think I use if I'm not using my pc or laptop
A Samsung smartfridge
It's so fucking buggy I can't stand it
I only open it on my desktop when I need to do a call
Shitty as hell
Because it's badly designed
There's ur answer
Don't. Use. Desktop. Messenger
So just gonna switch between reading manga and the book
Vrv is broken so I can't watch anime rn...
I'm just gonna read today
Prem, call on Thursday?
Well then
O it says due 27th
I got the tic tac toe code
That website he sent us
Gdi
Ah I forgot there was cs hw
So 1.1% drop
My 3rd quarter was 91.8
This is sem2
Danger zone
Like a 90.7 now
I could just roll with it but I don't want to just take a 1% drop...
Gdi
I thought he said it was fine to just share it
Like I sent it to him
I turned it on on time and the length was fine
God damn it
I think I didn't print it...
On the chapter 25 outline
Y did I get a 2
Um
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-myths-sex/202003/how-the-pandemic-is-changing-pornography
So worn out rn
Ima just sleep and get to work tmr
Gonna have to be productive for a day or two before I go back to doing nothing
My work kinda piled up a little tho
Same honestly
29th
20 pages in an hour is not good lol
Have not made good progress at all today
I'm 11% in
Oh the humanity!
Ah it's humanity
I don't know how that saying goes
Or is it humanity
Oh the humility!
Simply shocking!
Outrageous!
The whole bangs thing was cool but I ended up never really using it
So ended up going back to Google search engine
It seems nice but I couldn't get used to it
I can use duckduckgo if I wanted to tho
Yes ik
Same difference to me
I'll stay with ff for the foreseeable future
I like it
It does
Ublock let me watch anime without ads so it was my savior
It's a nice search engine but I doubt I would've been motivated enough to switch without ublock
For ublock on my phone
That's the sole reason I use Firefox really
Ublock is best
And I will remove ads
I hate ads
Tho I think I can pay like $2 to get those ads removed
The only place I see ads now is on my reddit app
Because Firefox gives u ublock on mobile
Firefox is good
Cool
O, it's like an escort kind of
The fuck is a geisha nurse
O nvm I remember now
I had a purpose in mind I thought
What was I gonna do...
I picked up my phone to do something
Ah
Sometimes I just dip to text ppl when I'm bored lol

Age is just a number

I need a little while to recover right after school
Kinda
Usually don't have the ability to do like 8th grade math right after school
I force myself to function for 6th then I crash
Idk y
I just tend to get really sleepy 5th period
Ig I was sleepy after I finished my lunch
Ik one time I had my head leaned back and mouth open during a Marty lecture
I am very good at sleeping

His voice lets me sleep
When I wake up from my naps I sometime tell him good morning
I sleep during his lectures mostly
The experience is just infinitely better with a monitor and proper headphones
I don't like watching it on a dinky laptop with my earbuds
I don't really watch much anime in class now, aside from math sometimes.
I usually sleep or screw around
Don't care to learn more cuz the most valuable thing I've learned in apcs is that I despise working with cs
I understand basic syntax and looping, that's about it
My body is, my mind is not
Yes the English, I understand
I too speak English
Damn lol
U could build a decent one for like 250 rn since u don't do any gaming
At least it'd be faster than ur laptop
Can't u get ur parents to let u build a cheap pc for coding
Oop
The video chat ended.
Flat is Justice joined the video chat.
Flat is Justice started a video chat.
Is that a TV show about the Civil War after the collapse of the Qin dynasty?
He liked the big stick that was used to stabilize the sea the most
A brief synopsis of prem's existence
The Buddha tried to advise him to not be so cocky but his advice couldn't be heard over the clapping of his dummy thicc cheeks
Buddha too thicc for him
Buddha is bad ass
Buddha really yote him hard
The hand of the Buddha
Or what was the stone ig
What was the stone called
The stick was to do something with the sea
One of the dragon God's palace
Buddha
Where did he get big stick
Bruh
Simple task, not niche or anime
Now tell me the plot of journey to the west
Same general ballpark
Close enough
The prologue also had three witches or some shit didn't it
Cool
I think he killed some dude in a duel? Can't remember the details
He also holds up a skull and asks it whether he should keep vibing
And I think his mom died too
But he die
So he kill uncle
Get revenge
His ghost dad be like
Do I want to kill my uncle for revenge
So he's like
Man's dad is killed by uncle who wants to become king
But I see he was the incorrect target
I make fun of will for being uncultured
...
Have u never watched Pokmon
I'm still reading right to left automatically when stuff is in panels
God damn it
Animemes is good too
They have nice fanart
My favorite subreddit is prolly the k on subreddit or the fate one
Hmm
So I haven't actually watched that much stuff
I think I've watched 55 seasons of stuff/movies by now
Myanimelist.net is there
And then it's some weird discord stuff
U can see some of the fanart I up voted there
After the anime it's some reddit stuff
I've only read 5 pages so it shows 5
Lmao
Those r just pages of the Manga
If u scroll down u can see the anime show I added to my watchlist and the one in watching rn
Not much
A song, some Manga
My current?
So no
I don't particularly wanna see it again
It's been a while since I've searched it up to find out what it was
Ik I don't
Don't search up that show if u value ur search history BTW
Is oreimo
But the pinnacle of anime
It is good
But not the best
Both r good
And no
No
There was a man there that was a bdsm machine
Idk if that counts
I watched kill la kill
Knees, toes, tongues, children
No kink shame
Don't kink shame
Yes
That is a name I have not heard of in a very long time
Smh
Than to kink shame.
U should know better
Asmi
Will don't kink shame

I'm so confused
What?
Me?
Wait
What about it
Yeah?
Mess what up?
?
...
He wanta toucha da knee
Close enough
But I'm just reading manga now
I was gonna read
Well
uwu
So it said uwi
And one of their signs was glitched out
Of this one time I went to regal
I have a picture somewhere
Furries *
Not just flurries
Yes
It's not an abbreviation
Doesn't stand for anything
Search it up on urban dictionary
uwu or owo
Either works
It was great
I remember when I first uwu-fied the trial
Lmao.
Y does everyone have such a different definition of boring then me :/
I liked it
Wait grapes was an interesting book
For one of my favorite book series I stayed up until 2 every night for a while reading it lol
That is indeed how entertainment works
I mean if ur tired ur gonna fall asleep
I got tripled teamed lol
Tho I did get a little emotionally worn out two days ago
I mean I'm not particularly stressed
Idk
Which is neat
I can apparently somewhat pass off as legal drinking age
U don't look the part
Idk y i just remembered that rn but that was funny as shit
Lmao
To slightly taller little boys
And that will and Ethan have turned from little boys
She told me we all looked like we've grown up a good bit
I remember at the start of this year when we started doing our club in her room
Lol
I just emailed Fulton for the TA form saying I missed the couch
Exactly
I am merely agreeing with a factual statement
Ez
Or pick one up from the local kindergarten
Just adopt one

Bold of u to assume I have one
Also gonna read bloom into you
Looks like a neat little show
I'm gonna start girls last tour
Flat is Justice set your nickname to Smoothbrain.
I should start reading now but I'm sleepy...
Sometimes I miss the stickers wechat has
Get pwned 
Gotem
Ur mum
That is my mind
Corrupt and dirty
Yes, it's gotten all corrupt
Flat is Justice set your nickname to Smoothbrain.
Ur brain is smooth
But ur like 25 pounds less than me lmao
Maybe u r a little taller than me, idk
But will I'm pretty sure ur somewhere around 5 8 to 5 9
I'm a little sleepy so I can't tell whether ur trying to be sarcastic...
R u... Serious?
Wait what
Idk y my body just decided to stop growing
I grow at like 1cm a year now...
I've been this height for about 3 years now
I'm like 5 8.5
Geoffrey is a little taller than me
I'm pretty sure ur like 5 8
Well fuck u too
Will how tall r u?
It's a little off putting to see all my friends growing as tall or taller than me lol
I haven't grown for the past 3 years...
A little I think
Damn lmao
Ur only a little shorter than me
Wait how much do u weigh?
Fits
Ur mental capacity is about half the norm too
OK then ur more like half
Just accept it
Nah u count as 1.5
Wonder who...
Guess I can just hop straight into my next show and manga
Still not bad tho
I am a little disappointed...
Those two movies were not as depressing as I expected
Hmm
Totally
Tho it's not like I do that all the time
Ig I'm not one to judge someone for wanting to say something for no reason
@Kiran Suresh
Have u started
Ay Kiran
Cool
For what purpose tho?
So...?
Disappointing
It seems they usually have different versions of exams
?
And that the east coast doesn't have a day's difference from us
Is makeup testing right
That the second date
U do realize
...
They don't do that with any of their other tests
I don't think so
I'm pretty sure everyone gets the same ap test
East coast
Some ppl will take it early right
There r gonna be lots of kids getting 5's this year
Or have a separate laptop with the doc open and copy it that way
And type it up
U could just hand write it beforehand
But
They'll prolly have an algorithm to stop copy pasting
I could finish an outline tonight...
Hmm
At this pace I'll prolly start working at 6
A second season for the show is unconfirmed so ig I've gotta go to the Manga
Tho I do want to start reading this Manga as well
Maybe I don't need that break before I start the second movie...
Mmm
Ur even more of a clown than prem
You've been in the class for over a semester
U actual rart
Bruh lmao
It's always been 5
5
I expected it to be more crushing and empty but it was actually really fulfilling
9/10
Was great
That movie
Fuck

So ima have to watch that show
And I am an emotional masochist
Julia told me the show was very emotional
I like cpop so Spotify put it in my discover weekly at some point
That songs been in my Playlist for a very long time
I didn't know I had the shows song in my Spotify Playlist until I saw the trailer on Netflix lmao
I'll get to it eventually
I've just got a ton of anime to get through
I have it on my Netflix watchlist
I'm planning to
8/10
Neat little show
Amagi brilliant park
Now it's time to die from the big sad with the movies I'm gonna watch
Took longer than usual watching it cuz I was reading manga simultaneously but whatever
That was neat
Just finished the show I started two days ago
I'm gonna watch that some day
I've got ghibli movies
Right
O wait
But I
I think I did have a third movie somewhere
Maybe I should take a break between the two movies as well
Ima just read Manga tonight until I recover ig
Too many choices...
Having fun
Amazing
Japanese men in rubber suits fighting each other
Ultraman was great
Well fuck I'll have to watch gridman then
Gridman was made in part by the dude who wrote for ultraman
O shit
O
Fuck
Wait no Babylonia gets emotional too...
Babylonia just wrapped up
Maybe I'll just watch some fate
I starting to run out of happy and fun shows
Ugh
Or maybe I'll start a rewatch
Or maybe blend S
A stupid fucking mecha show is exactly what I'll need tonight
Gridman
Hmm...
Or maybe I'll just read Manga instead of starting a new show
First ima decide what show to start tonight
Psych first or apush first... Hmm
Yeah psych outline due Friday
Psych and apush
I should be able to finish the movies by 4-5
Maybe I'll finish the book tonight
I might be able to finish an outline if I try too
Ima see if I can do more than just the book work tmr
Efficiency is the way to go

Ah the Manga was completed last November
Never did wrap up my rewatch, actually...
I'm prolly gonna start the bloom into you Manga next
Fuck
I just had to start looping a sad song while finishing this Manga too
I have two movies and a show to get through this afternoon
No
Fuck
I'm done with the Manga and I want more
Fuck fuck fuck
Fuck
God I hate this feeling
And I already feel hollow from finishing
I'm almost done
Well fuck
I dare u to say kill la kill and lose ur grade
Or violet evergarden
Tell docmo to watch anohana
I was gonna run right after finishing this Manga but ig I wanna show up for lipman zoom
I'll respond
If u say hi to me
Ray
Nick is a despicable human being
The cold war...
I'd be annoyed if they decided not to teach us the last five decades of history
And the last five decades definitely counts as basic and relevant
U should be learning basic and relevant history regardless
The class shouldn't be only oriented towards the test anyways
I think he just wants us to learn it
God I've actually never done lecture notes for apush before
Thursday looks like a busy day for me now
And skip around
Tho ig it won't be so bad if I just listen to music while he lectures
I really don't wanna do the lecture notes for apush
I'm prolly gonna see if I can copy the lecture notes off someone or something
I completely forgot about that
Wait when's that due
He doesn't pull this type of shit
Lipman isn't Dennis
Gj
I don't understand y
Lmao
@Geoffrey Xiang still assumes 27 is due this week for some reason
I'll just split the two outlines over the course of a day
I don't like being bored for 2 hours
It's a bore
One apush one psych
Not the worst schedule
And Thursday I'll do two outlines
Then the day after ima watch some anime
Ima finish the book stuff before I sleep tmr night
Tho whether or not I'll need to start a new show to cure my depression will affect my plans
I'll prolly start reading tonight on my kindle
Mmm
So I just gotta focus
I would be able to read prolly 350 pages a day
If I took out the time I spend rereading passages and the time I use to take breaks
If I get addicted to a book I usually read 250 pages over the course of a day
200 pages should take around 3-4 hours
So ig I'll finish the whole book tmr and get working on the assignment
Tho I might be a little too depressed to do much tonight
I can prolly finish tonight after my movies if I strapped down and focused
200 pages
The books pretty short
I don't wanna break my plans for the day
And two movies
I've got a show to finish today
I wanna run
Gonna see if I can finish the book tmr
Prolly gonna start going ham tonight
I've not done anything so my work has piled up
Same
As well
Means moving it earlier
Pushing the due date up
Lmao
Gj
What
Meant pushing it back?
Did u think moving the due date up
Wait Ben
O fuck I still have to message Fulton for ta
Lol
Lmao
That's what I remember too

U have stated the obvious
Gj
Yes
Had to stop myself and try again
I started reading that right to left as well
Gdi
Did u start any of the shows?
Ay Kiran
There goes our padding
O
Damn it
I've started reading memes right to left
Ah fuck
So I need to start today, prolly
I haven't read any of it
For the things they carried
The book writing assignment
This is very problematic to my scheduling
My work stacked up without me noticing
Fuck
Ugh
Ugh
I'll prolly have to buckle down and work after I'm done with this Manga
I'm not sure tho
O shit I gotta get working on that book then
Wait wasn't it originally due on the 31st
She hasn't said
So I have to work tmr
O great there's a dagen assignment due Wednesday
She bit her tongue
Bruh lmao
Ima show up to have fun
Idk
Some of the questions were hella gay lmao
I got a 12/18 cuz I wasn't sure whether or not Wyoming having a small population was common knowledge
Lmao
U tard
U already did it
For dagen
Ur mom
Then ima get depressed over the two movies I've got lined up today
I think I can finish the whole thing today
Ima just read Manga after I finish this ap classroom thing then
Do we just watch video lectures?
What r we really even gonna do with remote learning?
I just got an email about it
What is this self care Google classroom thing
I got got
Damn
Is dagen doing anything today?
So I never had much of a problem with it to begin with
My favorite romance show is actually yuri
Lesbian
It's
No
@prem
Ready?
Only requires one word
I'll give u the short and sweet explanation
Just curious
Do u know what yuri actually means?
O prem
Gotem
But I might be able to get through it better now that I've watched part of illya prisma
The problem with monogatari is how it deals with lolis, which I still find disturbing
There's so much yuri bait in one of my favorite shows it's actually insane
Yuri doesn't bother me at all anymore but that's not really a thing in monogatari
So I should be able to hold myself back from cringing and looking away
My tolerance for degeneracy has increased exponentially since my first watch
I'll prolly rewatch monogatari sometime soon
But I heard the show was a wild ride so I'll prolly give it a shot
And I fear that combination
Those were three words I never expected to see together
A yuri pedophile yandere
Get this
Yesterday I found a show with a character who's
Well
Good stuff
It has a pedophiliac triceratops
This show is neat
They just feel so unrealistic
Which is... Rare
Unless if they're handled correctly
Harems r kinda cliche and annoy me
Amagi brilliant park
...
This man is gonna get a harem too
Damn
So it's not a problem
Tho my mom didn't give a shit when she saw some kill la kill and monogatari
I do feel a little embarrassed about some of the shows I watched and would rather not show my parents lol
I watch nearly everything by myself with my pc setup
I don't watch stuff on my living room TV unless if I'm running lol
I watch by myself
The movie is actually brutal
Ye, shouko
I gave violet evergarden a 10 cuz how could I not
Also great
Bunny girl senpai movie was like the show but more brutal
Utterly amazing
Violet evergarden is just like the show
So I took a break by watching comedy
And even today I'm hella tired
And yesterday night I was actually just physically dead
That was over the course of two days
I cried four times over the course of those two movies
Then I watched the movie for violet evergarden and bunny girl senpai
Anohana did a number on me
Had to take a break from the complex shows cuz I was getting emotionally destroyed
Neither has real complex characters actually...
Actually not the show, the show has like two or three characters that would warrant more than one line...
Actually I should prolly do one for the Manga and the show I'm on rn
Bruh lmao
I only remember like five of the couples by name lmao
And the Manga I'm reading has too many characters for me to keep track of
Tho the stuff I'm watching rn isn't complex enough to really to anything with...
So I'd have a little more than just watching
To take note of how and why characters behaved
I actually started writing little character descriptions for every show I watched lol
Then I've been productive as fuck
But if u count the amount of shows and chapters I've gotten through as productive
Which is to say near absolute zero
My productivity has been generally the same
I'm just doing whatever I want whenever
Lmao
I just need to start making tea cuz cold water isn't great for my stomach
But now that we have a prolonged hiatus I need to get back in the habit of just making tea
So I usually don't drink much tea over weekends
Tho I don't make it super often when I don't go to school
I usually make loose leaved tea every morning before I go to school
Prolly just powder
Idk
Actually I used powder once and I hated it
Tho I can't say for sure since I never use powder
Leaves r the way to go
Ginger + date tea is pretty fire with the right amount of brown sugar
I've always used the leaves or whatever raw material
I'd assume so
And just assumed most ppl made tea normally
That was kinda surprising since I've never actually used pre-made packets before
And they were surprised I didn't use pre-made tea packets and stuff lol
Wait one day I was in a vc with some dudes and mentioned the tea I was making
Tea is so good
Bruh
What
When I leave date tea for a while it gets really decently sweet for me
But the sweetness comes out in the tea
They're not super sweet
Part of this is prolly the dates
Not half
3/4 sugar
Hmm
Actually
I'm gonna halve the sugar I use next time
I did add too much sugar
Actually wait
And it's actually so wholesome
It's basically the stories of a bunch of high school couples or ppl who like each other awkwardly trying to have functional relationships
Found this really cute romantic one I liked and I've been half binge reading it
I only just got into Manga like two days ago lol
The series in rereading for my 3rd time rn is a series of 13 700 page novels
Lmao.
Cuz the book series I like r... Gigantic
This is problematic with books more than shows
Since mid-late July
I tend to get nostalgic about my favorite books and shows, so whenever I feel like it I just go back to them
There's one show I've watched 6 times and am starting a 7th rewatch, and another I've watched 3 times
I've watched that movie at least 6 times by now
I think at least
Where two times I watched it twice in the same day
There's this one movie
Mmm
Or two days ago
I sent this yesterday
I have to manage my time a little
Actually it's already a bit of an issue
That's gonna become an issue with anime as well
I'm still having trouble getting to new series cuz I've read enough good stuff that I'm stuck in a cycle of rereads
I reread basically everything I liked lmao
Mmhm
Now I'm doing the same thing except part of that reading got replaced by watching anime
Over the summer I spent like 6-8 hours a day reading
Binge reading is really enjoyable for me if I take small breaks
I can relate
Obsession over a book
Mmm
The tea isn't as overly sweet as I feared
O

I have sinned to prove it
Haha
That line can no longer be used
I am factually not gay
I'm just eating my dates and waiting for my tea to cool down
Idk what's going on now tho
And I got annoyed
Then he started talking down on me using CS
So basically we got into a retard argument like we usually do
It was a joke, just not related to the whole humanities thing u were thinking of
And u should be smart enough to know that studying humanities isn't related to... Food taste
I was trying to find the moment I forgot about the humanities thing lol
I think I dropped it around here?

I dropped the whole humanities thing when I got bored of it
I was talking about culture cuz I was talking about culture
Lmao
No I wasn't
What
Humanities is the study of culture, human existence, and history
What about it?
That is factual
?
Lmao
Just food and culture
But I wasn't even talking about humanities at that point
Neither is humanities
Fuck that date was a little sour
Knowledge and skill r not subjective tastes
That's subjective taste in food
It'd be like if someone clowned me for not being good at grammar back in freshmen year
It's annoying
But when u start talking down on me as if I'm a grade schooler who can't comprehend basic cs syntax
Cuz it's subjective and stupid
Arguing which one is better is whatever
But even with the humanities vs stem thing right
A tablespoon is too much for a pot
Yeah I put a little much sugar
Dates taste nice...
Just went around whichever way
I didn't have contentions
Gj misunderstanding the point
Lmao
It was never about humanities vs stem
Wait the argument was that ur barbaric
Knowledge and skill r another
Grades and trivia r one thing
Cuz it's condescending
I don't like joking about actual knowledge and skill
But it's really fucking annoying
Yes ik
And ur joking as if I'm an elementary schooler below ur station
I'm joking about ur taste in food
And I'm gonna go back to watching anime cuz I don't like being talked down on
But what I do know is that ur being a dick
I don't know the last one
U actually get really annoying when u start pretending I don't know even the first thing about cs...
But ik that != means
I admit I am bad at it
I'm not as stupid as u think I am despite hating cs
Yes ik will
And I am better at humanities
I am more cultured
Just such an insignificant argument that I didn't deign address it
Literal elementary school math lmao
I am more cultured by being actually Chinese
So ur merely proving my point that ur barbaric by downtalking the west
U can't even eat pork feet or intestines
U can't refute the fact that ur more western than eastern
U r western urself, u know
But it proves they had the capacity for stem
So it is not hasty feneralizationn
There also Galileo, da Vinci, and a lot of other western mathematicians
Since ur such a barbaric westerner
U have failed to consider the best system of beliefs will
Tho if u look at it a certain way I could be considered one
No
Get ur insults straight
And I'm not a nihilist
Only a barbarian would discriminate based on beliefs
And u epitomize that, being the westerner u r
Thus barbarians can do complex math
So it's proof that Westerners have the capacity to create complex math
Newton came up with calculus
But Westerners can do math
This is known
Barbarians can do math
Westerners can do math
Westerners r barbarians
It's just a factual Statement
It is not
Well u can, so barbarians can obviously do math
Correct
Stem is numbers, even a barbarian can be intelligent
Because it's literally about culture
Humanities is the mark of culture
That is factually incorrect
I have turned the tables on u will
Which one of us is better at humanities?
Cuz they lack proper culture
Barbarians r inferior at humanities
No shit
There's a writing assignment?
It's like needles
Just in constant, very annoying pain
My left hand is usable
I mean I can click just fine with my right hand
Aight
Did I say right?
O wait it's my left hand that's burnt
My gaming time has actually gone down a lot
Iv mostly been watching and reading stuff so
I have two outlines due Friday
I'll prolly have to be productive on Thursday
Bruh lmao
No
Bruh r u cursing me to never heal my hand
I had to pause for a moment climbing up the stairs cuz I spilled it and it stung
This is annoying
Now my left thumb is in pain
And I spilled a little, burnt my hand
I think I did add a bit too much sugar
Fuck
Everything u say

Will has a permanent inferiority complex
I wrote the title
Ima finish it Thursday
Haha
Ha
Did will just get clowned
Concerning
Hmmm
Maybe I added a little too much brown sugar...
I hope my tea turns out well today
Will actually do be existing in a world of comparison
Bruh
Most of my books r behind a screen as well so
I mean what do u do when u get tired of looking at ur monitor
Nah
Partial at best
So I'm not a total antithesis
I have spurts of productivity
Hey
Can't relate
Instead of binge watching/reading shit
Imagine doing work rn
https://mashable.com/article/poland-coronavirus-minecraft-gaming/
Can't relate
Imagine having finished it already
That kinda hurt
I just fell out of my bed
Ah
Something tells me this isn't the healthiest existence
...
I take a break by staring at another screen for a little while
When I get tired of staring at one screen for too long
It's not racist if it's not directed at a human
Gj
Well u done fucked up somehow
It's prolly the one I bought the ebook for
One was end of month but I don't remember which...
Idk when they're due tho
Ye
What test was it from?
Didn't even see the Pic
I remember that passage by the umbilical cord thing tho
I didn't see lol
O u sent a Pic of it
Where is it from
How do I remember that passage?
It's about a bridge
O ik that passage
So ima do it at like 4 tmr
It's due 5pm tmr
Ye
I recognize it lmao
It's in my bag
O wait I have that paper
I don't remember those by now...
Life is becoming a lot more problematic than I thought it would...
Cuz I always forget to check
I usually rely on teachers saying the hw to remember it and don't check much
Wait I'm kinda gonna get fucked by online schooling
The what
I never got around to watching I want to eat your pancreas
O fuck
Bounce bounce
I was hitting it with my power bank that one time iirc
Ray set her own nickname to Flat is Justice.
Ur abhishek body pillow should be proof enough
2d is best
That is factual
They're both named Ben
I found a similarity between Ben and Ben
That's it for chrome
I never use it
I should disable Chrome on mobile
Huh
At least I don't overthink it
Imagine being competitive

Ok simp
Idk, I'd just use them the same way
It's not an interpretation
Lol
That's a direct quote from the website
Is what this one random website says
So geek r fans and nerds r practitioners
Well that's super fucking arbitrary...
Nerds focus on acquiring knowledge or skill instead of trivia and memorabilia
A geek is an enthusiast of a particular topic or field  who collect facts and momentos related to their interest
Idk the difference between the two but ik that's wrong
Yeah then you've got the wrong idea
So if u evaluate on that ur just doing it wrong
Lmao.
And so is being a geek
Nerdiness is completely unrelated to college
Wait
I still don't remember difference
Cuz I've watched movies that I consider better since then
Tho I did bump it down a lot in my movies list...
Watch it
Dude it's good
Not bad
I've actually got a good few shows and movies I'm waiting on as well as a book
Hmm
That's worth waiting for too
O yuru camp season 2 and snafu season 3
I just started getting a little into Manga but I'm still not super into it
O there's Evangelion
I'm hyped for that as well
Zomebieland saga season 2
O wait that's a lie
Otherwise idk what else is coming out that I'm
I'm just waiting for more kyoani and fate in general
There's a ton of good shit season 4 will adapt
Ye
...
Basically rotten tomatoes but weeb and better
Myanimelist
I want emotions and character, don't give two shits about plot
Again, not my type of show
Death note is 8.63
Season 3 part 2 for aot is a 9.08 or something on mal
At least season 3 does
Aot has a higher rating
No it is
I'm pretty sure it's worse than aot
Not my type of thing
Haven't watched, prolly never will.
Hmm
I've only ever picked up and watched one or two bad shows before...
Huh, it's actually around the middle out of all the shows I've watched...
It's like #20 out of everything I've watched, or 13 if u count entire series as 1
Solid 8/10
Good show
Ye
He's Korean
Nah
Sry
Both of u r irrelevant so I mixed u up
O u have the same empty pfp as Ben still
Violet evergarden was so good...
U know what I'm talking about
U watched anohana
I could get through a lot more shows if getting emotional wasn't so tiring
I was taking a break from anime cuz I was both physically and emotionally exhausted
Chapter 35 reading guide
Im doing some bio hw due a week and. A half ago
Icic
O
Which book
Which one?
Prem
@Kiran Suresh hast thou watched
But at least I habituated myself to the song that was making me depressed so that's something...
I am not very happy rn
I got shafted on 4 put of my 5 ap tests
And it's the only part of American history I actually find interesting
Cuz that's 90% of my apush pk
So I'm fucked
Is what prem said.
Everything after 1945
Go watch highschool dxd while ur heading out then
Ig it counts as romance?
It's a nice show
Rhh
Still makes me a little emotional tho...
Time to add it to my Playlist
God I've finally gotten over the anohana song
Such a nice little show
Have u watched tsurezure children?
Ben.
No
Outa here
No
Saber is king
Saber is great
Flat is Justice cleared the nickname for ChanYoung Ben Kim.
Not forever
U can't escape ur desires will

Don't lie will
Cuz ur will
Tho that is not a loli
Ah yes, both u and Ben would love lewding lolis
Totally
Totally fine
U see
Nah
She has a good uniform.
Like ryouko from kill la kill
But there r better characters to cosplay
I do not recognize what she is cosplaying
Ur lack of taste is disturbing
Astolfo is a beautiful man
Ofc I'm jotn
Lemme find u a picture of a truly beautiful man
I have slacked
Tho ig I did finish another one at like 2am
Only finished one show, and a short one at that
Today was an off day ig
I did not start a second show today
What do I say most often
More often fuck or fucc
I occasionally say fuk
Bruh
Cuz I accidentally use periods sometimes
You'd catch a lot of my texts
Now I have a healthy addiction to anime
The gateway drug
9th grade was the introduction
But the formal beginning was summer
Tho the true beginning was back in 9th grade
Is when I started... Haruhi?
Right after coming back from China
July
Summer
I'm dying from my decision to stay up late binge watching last night
Nice
Lmao
What is this about
Succumb
Watch anime
U look slightly less blocky now.
DIO
But it was me
You thought it was an anime girl
The characters
I remember one of those
UwU
Because
That rhymed
Fucc
Bruh my game is stuck
Idk y
U did but I wouldn't exactly say it's leadership...
Also how do u have 2
When r apush outlines due again?
Smh
Ima have to do actual work this weekend
Like mun, debate, even deca, what have u
A club with an actual command structure and whatnot
Lmao
That's more like a loose coalition of ppl than an actual organized group with cohesive leadership
Prem can attest
I am good at being dead weight
That is one trait u don't really have
Lmao
I don't think u should put leadership
Wait will
Fuck
It's making me depressed
How do I get this song out of my head
Fuck
Lol
Harker debate bad
I don't think he has what it takes Tbh
Gg
Lmao
Except for cs since idk any of the stuff on the test anyways...
I really just got shafted in almost every ap test I have...
Two out of my three favorites...
Psych cut social and clinical psychology
Wow
So I got shafted
I liked ecology and natural selection tho
Yeah and I hate it
I just had that happen with two classes
At least u didn't just lose pretty much everything u knew for a class
@Anaani Muss what's getting cut from psych?
Idk what any of that means but cool
What did they cut from cs and psych
FUCK
Alright I think that means they cut the only two units of bio I find genuinely interesting
Omg I'm actually get so fucking shafted
Is evolutionary biology one of the remaining units?
Fuck me
Y did they keep fucking biochem
NOOOO
THOSE R THE UNITS I LIKE
FUCK
FUCK
Fuuuuuck
Holy fuck literally all of my apush pk just got cut
Where do I find this info for bio?
Ig I'm kinda fucked
Well
All ik of of US history
That's like
NOOOO
COLD WAR
WHAT
Can anyone find what's being cut from bio and apush?
So it's just making me sad lmao
And it's stuck in my head
Bruh anohana weaponized it's song
Spent like half an hour adding in everything
Just made a Mal account to keep track of all the anime I've watched
Fuck y is my second hand embarrassment reflex so strong
It's next week
Some ppl pronounce it that way
Tard
This meme was made by ufotable and kyoani
Imagine not having both
Leave the others be
Gonna just
Well ima have to pull some quality shows from a1 pictures
I did not expect to see fate apocrypha here...
...
Ha they made blend s
Out of here
Will no one cares about ur skinny ass either
To kaguya
From fucking eromanga sense
How u can go from oreimo to anohana
I cannot understand
All the same fucking studio
Fairytail, franxx
Like what the fuck
O and eromanga sensai
And also ylia
They made fucking oreimo and sao
I can't wrap my head around this
What the fucm
Oreimo?
Made fucking
The same studio that made anohana
Ben
Also
Weebs were classified as nerds too, tho idk if that's changed by now
There's more than one type of nerd lmao
It's neat
Cuz
God y does Netflix make me use edge
O I just put a small dent in my door cuz I tried closing it only with this metal thing
This one is good
What's my all time favorite
Looks good tho
I already had dinner.
Food?
That's problematic rhetoric
God's anus
Actually such a good show
@headass lookin ass pod watch a place further than the universe

Tho rn I'm kinda having a hard time taking it seriously
Big sad anime.
Anime
Someone must already have
Someone could take that whole wish granting thing to a different direction in a doujin
Lmao
That's exactly what I'm watching rn
Maybe I could even work out a schedule for myself
Ima have to decide what show I'm gonna start tmr
My brain has deteriorated in a good way
God my mind is going places with that sentence

Liberal spotted!!
Yeah he doesn't matter
Kiran was 2nd period but ig he doesn't matter
Y
9th grade?
Prolly a while ago
That last time I did it was over discord

U know not what u have just said
That number
So it's just like abhishek saying it
Aadithyaa kinda just does what abhishek does tho
Not an in between
I want either written or animated
I don't like Manga Tbh
The books will sustain me for about a month after my anime runs out
Wait actually I got hella books too
Is gonna be the moment I die
The moment I run out of quality anime tho
So I'd have three shows finished in the same day
I could finish the show I started a few hours ago to ogjt
I'm actually gonna get through all of my Playlist at this rate
Bruh
One of my friends back in China got into cards and lost all his money cuz he was so bored lmao
Bored, won't be able to see friends, Julia, etc
But I've adjusted surprisingly well thanks to the sheer amount of fucking shows I've horded in my watchlist
I thought u was gonna get kinda screwed cuz of this social isolation
Ya know
U can make a toddler laugh and giggle by tickling her
This is problematic
I'm taking four meals to finish the rice I usually eat in two
God am I eating less now for some reason
But I don't ever
I would use it if I ever felt like talking in that cutesy baby voice
Asinine
They're prolly a little salty for most ppl
At least I think they're great
So I can feed myself
I make great chicken wings
Hey
I'm actually gonna die
I almost fell over opening my own door
How have I not noticed
What
That's problematic prem
It's like such a soft word to use
Idk y but I find the word funny
I use problematic as a joke
It's helpless but it's what it is
Some things u can't live without when ur in China, so I can't go wholesale ccp free
There r necessities that I can't get away with
Not never
Simple as that
Because it supports my govt
I was talking about the platform.
I mean I could say it's cuz of the govt they're tied to
But this was the first line I said

Yes abhishek, great job finding stuff I now admit as being wrong
I decided not to use the thing a long before before the eugenics thing
Tho the eugenics thing was part of it
I thought I said it was tied to my govt too
It shouldn't need a genius to know how I feel about the Chinese govt

So in no world was I gonna support it, if I could manage to stay away
I already know they're connected to my government
But tik tok?
If it was a company I actually cared about I'd I look into it
That's the reason I tell myself I inherently don't like the app
More like cuz of the Chinese govt
Don't care enough about tik tok to actually investigate
Welp idk, too lazy to read it myself tbh
Lmao
An anecdote does not disprove it
Not every social media actively prevents the disadvantaged from having a voice
How they filter our the disabled, LGBT, and poor from the mainstream?
So u haven't heard?
Rather not financially support a company like that
Virtual eugenics, ig
I wouldn't use a platform that basically plays eugenics
Wait have u guys not seen the news lately?
The company's practices themselves r
It's more than just politics
I'm never stepping foot in that piss soaked carpet of a platform
It's a scummy company supported by a government that's even worse
The funny!
Hehe
And I make movement large
I make funny voice
Haha
Like how do u apply now, since getting a slip of paper to the office obviously isn't an option anymore
Does anyone know how ta is gonna work now
Um
Too lazy to read
Is that good or bad?
Vampire loli
Teachers should twitch stream
I, too, speak English
Ah yes
Fucc yeah
O
I should prolly do something on Saturday
Gj Graydon
I don't make the decisions
Don't ask me
Send pictures
So nowhere near
Psych outline due 27th for rozelle
No
Ima just eat and watch anime then
O aight bet
O I gotta do the stupid apush web quest don't I
When is that due?
Thanks for reminding me
I did
U know what I mean by bdrip
A bit of a pain when the only high quality bdrip I could find was raw and prolly doesn't have subs
I'll have to download subtitles for some of these later...
I just gotta tune out the bad parts so I can get to the good parts
The show is... Problematic
Same series ig
But it is monogatari
That's not kizumonogatari
Google barely functions when three shows r downloading at once
And it eats up the wifi for my pc
Cuz I'm downloading all of monogatari and it's gonna take fucking forever
Today ima just go through stuff I downloaded but hadn't watched
Watching kizumonogatari rn
The pasta will remain dry
Don't particularly want to find the sauce either
I do not know the sauce
I'm just trying to watch my anime don't kill me plz
Y is everything going down the shitter even more
Bruh
Ever
No one should watch tik tok
It's not just gen z
Plenty of millennials and whatnot play minecraft
uwu
Cool
I have a nickname?
At this rate I'm gonna have to buy another hdd
Finished an amazing show this morning and will prolly get through a movie trilogy by the end of the night
Cuz I'm downloading like 6 shows at once
My pc wifi is so slow now
Asteroid
Neil is a fine specimin
I'll buy one when I need it
Hey will show ur nostrils with ur webcam
Can't relate
Imagine having a webcam
No it's ur mum
Sad Boi hours
Isn't showing
The pfp I just set
Bruh
Hello Ryan's iPhone
Lick it off
Actual camp
I don't have webcam
Just mute urself
Join with audio
Been cutting back on gaming a little to accommodate for the sheer amount of shows I have
But I think I'll finish the show I started yesterday today
I've gotten a little burnt out on anime
Lipman
Did yall just get the email?
What is this 1pm zoom meeting
Hah
O
I've been watching so much these past two days
Gonna take a quick break from anime
Ima just browse reddit while listening to music
Rip

This meme was made in 2016
Lmao
That's just sheet music

Arti
CNN really had to do it to em
https://twitter.com/YaiSor/status/1239864382571544576?s=20

I'm back on the grind
Two shows in three days
It's been a long time since I've been having such a good time not being in school
So I'm gonna try and get through illya prisma again
I did say I was gonna make some headway on my watchlist
Well
I didn't read the latest email
O lmao
Wqt
Balancing act
But brown sugar is nice
Ginger tea tastes odd
Prolly tmr
I should finish my sip thing
Icic
O the bio thing
What be ysp
Two?

Ima mute this chat for a while
My circadian rhythm is being pushed back every day now
Time to eat breakfast
Gj noticing

Their calories
Fat ppl should burn
So funny
The yt videos of obese ppl screaming and fighting over tp
Everyone can use some love in these dire times
She needs some love too
Yes
Fuck fuck fuck
Fuck
https://www.ajc.com/blog/get-schooled/college-board-cancels-may-sat-and-plans-for-possible-home-testing/CGl75fyIXcqCptDwajQTzI/
Just like I did on the dagen classroom
Ima post history memes
Gimme his class code
The vhl
Thing
What's tha5bth8ngn
No psych outline for me
ye
Ima have to find some shit on Netflix ig
This was my main plan for how to spend my time
What am I gonna do
My anime streaming service is freaking out
FUCK
Bruh lmao
Yes
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Asmi Mukherjee to Misery.
Nice
First thing I see when I wake up
Look up the word Yuri as well
Just stuff that's scared me before
Lmao
I don't watch horror so idk any actual horror
No
It ended up being too much even for me
That's all I'm gonna say
Yuri lolis
For other reasons
Illya prisma also scared me
That thing scares me
The emoji movie
Lmao
I saw it typed differently and thought it was wrong so I checked
I never realized until like last year
Lmao
Cuz my mom talked about how the constant drizzle would make stuff moldy
I always thought the first character was 
Feels like 
Damn it's been raining this whole day
Heh
I still have a folder of urs
So u have like five quotes of me now
Cuz ur a capper will
Nah it's just u
I did just type that didn't I
O
Stood up too quickly and felt like I was gonna fall down for a moment lmao
So I was squatting to stretch my tendons and shit out a little
Kinda died while running today
I just got off my treadmill lmao
O fuck I stood up too quickly
I will emerge lslsllrkwmsl) victorious over my will to be productive
I will make a sizeable impact on my watch list
Over the next few weeks
I'm almost done with this show
Ray set her own nickname to Cultured.
Flat is Justice set your nickname to Capper.
Flat is Justice cleared your nickname.
Can't trust anything u say
Ur a capper
Nah that's cap
U r the one who is incorrect
Lmao
And off centered
The faint is smaller
Literally Hitler
What a boolie
Smh
Trying to bully prem without cause
Yeah will
Feel Geoffrey's leg every night - @Will Liang
More like *
Mofd like
Holy shit it's still raining lmao
Betrayal
U really gonna do that to her
Damn
A literal chain of 5 ppl
Bruh the show I'm watching rn has a love vector lmao
No
U don't even have 95 reasons
You've doomed urself
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Robert Gan to Heathen.
U dirty heathen
Sacrilege
Y
No
Robert
That is not allowed
Robert
HEY
Hey
Congrats on
Lmao
The ec can being my grade up by a letter
Is this big brain time
If I get most of the ec in my math class, I can get an 80 on the final and still have an A despite my 20% participation
According to my calculations
Wait a second
Jesus
Y is Khan academy graphing so fucking sped
Oh my God
Gj
Can't relate
Imagine using a 24in display
Do u get more than one monitor?
But do u get 144hz?
And it's not u
One of us can game at 144hz
I hope the next Gen gpus offer a nice 1440p 144hz midrange
Instead of 120fps
Imagine playing at 30fps
So the shortened lifespan doesn't matter
Not gonna keep any gpu for over 5 years, prolly
And I'm gonna upgrade the thing in the next year
But the gpu would last like 10 years otherwise
It removes prolly a year or two of life from the gpu
Which means it generates even more heatb
Cuz I uncap the power limits and it just sucks as much power as it wants
It gets going quick
When I oc
Until I oc it
But it takes a while to get my room stuffy usually
It gets pretty hot
When u run a gpu on max for hours
Cuz it does
Gj
Blow away
Heat bad
In short
Gpu not damaged
Get heat out of gpu
So fan spin
Damage bad
Too hot mean damage
Gpu run hot
The gpu has a fan on it
So
Lmao
Because it's removing the heat from the gpu
That's y the room is so toasty
It's doing its job
What
My pc cooling or my homes?
?
So haven't gotten the habit of keeping my windows closed
I hadn't had allergic reactions until recently
My pc can act as a heater when I let it go lmao
Cuz I had my pc going and it was getting stuffy
I opened my window earlier to let some air out
Fuck that tree in particular
There's this bitch of a tree right outside my window
Yup
Awesome
I'm dying of allergies now
Damn
I thought u were taking about Geoffrey
What's he doing?
?
Ought to keep me busy
Sprinkle a little learning in between my gaming sessions
I guess I could read my history books
It is
And ur gonna rule the galaxy
U didn't even know what a foreskin was
Yeah right
So ur just as unproductive as me
It's in principle the exact same thing
Ur just entertaining urself
Just cuz it's not gaming doesn't mean it's productive
Y would that be more productive than what I'm doing?
Math?
What r u doing with ur time?
I almost wish there was hw cuz I gotta do something when I feel like being productive
And watch stuff
Except game
I've got nothing to do for the next two days too
I'm tired from a whole day of gaming
If there isn't we good
If there is I won't show up to 6th
I'll just need to find out if there is an essay or not
Not that ik of
No
It is optional, after all
Maybe I shouldn't
Should I show up Monday dagen
Um
I got an email
Das kinda gay
Inb4 ap tests canceled
The pasta is fry
Fuck me, may sat time
Cal east bay has closed
Welp
It's a loss of mental health we cannot afford
Ye
Me neither lmao
Or I'll end up using the extra time to add more shit and end up with a bigger list
Ima make a large dent in my watch list
If school gets canceled
Well
https://i.redd.it/0wjrx1g3kfm41.gif
I'm down
So let's just have school without classes
Classrooms r usually somewhat large groups of students
Like classrooms? Maybe?
A safe space
Just keep like a safety bubble around each person
Social distancing?
That'd be great
On a bed instead of on a desk
This means I can sleep properly while teachers lecture, if they do remote
Cuz oc they aren't
I don't think cb is up to date
At least I think asmi was taking somewhere else
That's where I'm at
No asmi is at somewhere else
I just got that email too
But idk if they canceled the sat
They suspended in person classes
Cal east bay
Fucks sake
The office
Great, they're closed rn
So I'd just pile another test on top of my other tests
Tho then I'd have to take the sat in May
Fuck I kinda do hope it's canceled
Maybe I should do that too
Hmm
Does cb send an email?
@Asmi Mukherjee how do u know?
Lmao
31st
Ye lmao
I messaged u on discord
Where u at
Prem.
Gimme prolly 10 and I'll be ready
O ima just do my dishes rn

Yes

@prem when can call
Trudeu wife positive for corona
O
Watch this
Hey will
Nah but

Ye lmao
I'm an alcoholic
Yup
Another flaw has been found in Intel cpus
Lmao
Ah
Ye it's cuz of the alcohol
This is bad
My cold is getting worse
Ugh
Joestar
Next year?
But he's taking us so I'm good
So I'd skip math
And just dislike math
I just like most of those classes
So I could dip from any of them.
In the morning I have all my easy classes
3rd
Lmao
I would've skipped his class to go if he didn't tho
Which is great
My math teacher is taking our class

Prolly the 1000 ppl rule Santa Clara imposed being adopted
That's what I've heard
But talent show isn't
Mcc is
Aime boi
Rip will tho
I'm hyped
Parkhi
Tmr talent show
Dwai
He already is
His
It's over anakin
Tho ig I'm not one to talk cuz I just spent like ten minutes goading him into a rant
Cuz that's kinda humiliating
I wasn't gonna say that lmao
O cmon
I have to keep at least
Cuz methodology
She technically rejected him the morning after the ask
But I don't think u were
I was there the first time she said she wasn't gonna
Did she decide a second time?
Lmao
No one knew
See?
No one knew
Wdym
Had no idea
A revelation
Wow
Nice
That was fun
@Will Liang i successfully poked addoocha into a little rant
It's modern art
The only words r the titles of the sections and our names
Lmao
Cuz it's literally only pictures
U wouldn't understand it
This presentation gonna be ebic
Am done
I'm pretty sure it's true tho
Cuz I'm too lazy to look it up
I don't have a source for one of my things
Do we have to have links to sources
Pepsi
How much outside info r we actually supposed to have
But the gacha is too much even for me
No cap I've considered fgo
Time to play games for a while
That's all put of my system
Yup I don't feel like being productive at all now
Thanks to India, China no longer needs to burn its trash outdoors
Think less land, more garbage disposal
Instead of one that never had a democracy to begin with
Imagine being in a country that has a failing democracy
So Pakistan is elevated by china's radiance
It's just that Pakistan has relations with China
Not big difference
Tho that's like saying 0.1>0
Pakistan > India
I only started outlines cuz I felt like being at least a little productive
Wait I actually had zero work this weekend lmao
Uh oh
...
Bruh wdym
It disappeared
I had a flash of inspiration to be productive for a little
Who tf calls outlines notes
Wait r they talking about lecture notes or outlines
That's outlines yeah
Lmao
Did I finish it myself? No
I mean I have the code for it
My current workload is around 2-5 hours on a weekend
My 5th grade weekend workload was around 3-4 hours
Now that I think of it
Lmao
I prolly had a similar workload in 5th grade
Wait
Nogees
But I like the periods
There's two classes that I don't like
I like all my class periods
I miss 5th grade
I'm on about the same level of stress as I was back in 5th grade
Doubt my life will ever be so chill again
I'm gonna miss this year
I forsee about an hours worth of work
I'll be a little productive when I get home tmr
Cuz I've found a new anime worth binge watching during classes
Ima get my life back on track tmr
That's true for rozelle
Is it not whenever the test is?
Rather than screwing up democracies
They'd prolly be more useful as fertilizer
Multi-player games always prove me otherwise
Sometimes I think the average person can't be as stupid as everyone says
Lmao
I also asked him if he knew y he was mentally impaired
Cuz he didn't seem to understand 450>430
Also asked him if the education system failed him or if it was just him
But fun
It was a pretty moderate flame
I told him I was sorry for his mental handicap
Lmao
So I just trash talked him to have some fun
He just raging at me
Nah
Feels good
Today I trash talked someone online for the first time in a very long time
He's actually mentally handicapped lmao
That man needs the fbi
No
To protect u from the fbi
I can enculture u
Ur about to get enculturated
Nah
Bruh lmao
Too long to bother rn
Ima fill out this summer program thing later
No
Unless anyone else knows how to find it
Also seems like I'll have to talk to my counselor for the second time ever to find this stupid CA ssid
My grade still depressed from participation tho
Cuz I usually make one retarded mistake or another lmao
Which is nice
First time I ever actually aced
Ye
Nice
My hw average is about to breach 90%
@Graydon Perry dixon put grades up
Haven't been chilling this much on a Sunday afternoon in a while
Maybe it's just cuz dagen didn't give anything, and we're almost done on psych
Is it just me or is school slowing down a little rn
Or I could do that in psych tmr
He's prolly checking tmr
Might make it an hour by copying down the answers to math hw
20-40 minutes
Lmao
More like 40 minutes
Actually wait
Tues
I've done about 1 hour of work this whole weekend
A new record
This weekend has been my most unproductive weekend yet
I'm prolly gonna finish it in classes tmr
Should prolly get back to outlines
I'm tired from chilling
Yup
Hopefully it shows up eventually and the virus doesn't get to be enough of an issue that I'm too worried to go.
I wanna watch that movie in theaters
Welp there's no listing for fate yet
Illusory
Existence is a problem the school must solve
Cuz u exist
Get corona and die
Cuz fuck u that's y
We do
What have I stumbled upon
I was just trying to see if there's a listing for fate
That's... Great
There's a new Digimon movie too
O
...
WHAT
...
Ugh
When's the apush presentation thing
Hey
Gonna have to sift through this artist's songs tmr
I found a trove of nice Japanese music
Ah

And the fish sometimes makes farting nosies
So she got a fish on her knee
She got cursed
This girl in this anime.
See
It means
Lmao
Girl got cursed and got a farting fish face on her knee
This show is good, judging by first episode
Mc was carefully examining the thigh
I need an astolfo plushie
Astolfo is unbeatable
That trap is low quality compared to what fate has to offer
Nah
Holy fuck that Ed was fire
Just like how I started bunny girl for that ed
Half the reason y I'm considering that show is cuz of the op
Lmao
I should add it sometime
Wait do I have blend s in my watch list
Well that didn't take me long
A TRAP
AHAH
Ah
Y tf that sunfish so small
Whoa
I'm gonna start with that
Nagi no asakura
So many choices
Hmm
Should I go with that
A place further than the universe
And I don't even play that game
Ik I would
Well time to kill urself
They've been sitting there for so long
I'm gonna need to start with these shows at the bottom of my wait list
Try
Tell me something new then
Well I already fucking know that
Bitch
Tell me
Well which time line
Which time line
Which Saber
Trying to dodge the fate spoilers while waiting for the show to finish up is hard
Time isn't gonna waste itself
I need to get my act together and start binge watching again
I haven't gotten around to watching any of the stuff I've been wanting to watch...
I still haven't gotten around to watching that yet
Before he left I'd been trying to poke him into one for a while
The rest of us kinda wanted him back cuz when he goes on his retarded rants it's kinda funny
Ethan was tired with his shit, k assume, so didn't want to add him back
He just up and left for no reason as far as I could tell
He didn't get banned
So it kinda got on my nerves after a while
And like every other day
Aadithyaa just drops it for no reason
But I usually don't know what's going on anyways
I usually just ignore it
Maybe
Now it's just a habit tho
I did it to make stuff more casual
At least that was the idea at first
I kinda do my thing for the same thing
Like if I'm talking to someone I'll notice a sock is missing and type that out during the convo
Kinda like how I randomly commentate on my life
Just post random song lyrics in the middle of convos for no reason
At least u do it infrequently enough that I can just ignore u
It's annoying
He does the lyrics thing so often tho
Idk what else between u two is exactly comparable lmao
Which, to be fair, he did copy from u
Prolly just him posting random lyrics
Shocking news
Next thing someone will say abhishek caps
That's news to me
He didn't bother blocking me
Lmao
Lmao
He doesn't make sense
It's aadithyaa
We're already commies
We're Chinese
I mean
America would've lost the cold war
Bro if the soviets were just anime girls
When r we presenting this?
Bruh lmao.
?
Put to good use
The finest of machine learning and deep faking technology
Ah yes
Booli
Gj making Ethan feel bad will
I think he's talking about himself
Bruh lmao
Actual godly curve lmao
Wait yeah
Imagine getting flexed on by nick
Nice
And so r u
Subtraction is ez
Violets r blue
Rides r red
Perfect
Not just the men, but the women and children too
Roses r red, violets r blue
Nothing turns ur crush on more than genocide
She's popular
So
But everyone knows her name
I just know her name
Bruh lmao.

Gotem
Ur mum
Ima find an online version of this and read tmr
It has to be truck-kun or its not the same
But it isn't a truck is it?
More so than sleeping in compsci is
Sounds interesting
Ic
Damn
It is like a documentary or something
See what?
We've never experienced it before
It's for seniors I thought
What exactly happens?
Flat is Justice set your nickname to .
Flat is Justice set your nickname to .
Flat is Justice cleared your nickname.
Time to get back to this stupid outline
Flat is Justice set your nickname to .
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Geoffrey Xiang to Voraphile.
Vore
It's what will will grow up to draw for a living
Vore is great
Ray set her own nickname to .
Flat is Justice set your nickname to .
He's a milf hunter
Flat is Justice set your nickname to .
Flat is Justice set your nickname to Uncultured barbarian.
U have only defiled urself further
Inferior*inferior
Yeah that's a mixture of Japanese and western
I will not have this
This is literally defamation
Ethan will is trying to sully my name
Slander
But u misused Chinese, a graver offense that out rules my inability to use an inferior language
I must fight the barbarian by becoming barbaric

That's flexing on u
U see that?
And
But just to show u how superior I am, I will momentarily stoop down to ur level
So ur still inferior
Yeah that's still Japanese
Inferior
A Japanese invention
Ur name reflects it
Just shows how uncultured u r
Inferior
A western invention
Which means I won in the end
Then I responded successfully
U responded to failure with failure
So get fucked
Since I am at a higher level
Therefore I have the higher ground
I have control of the higher tongue
The higher tongue
U understand the inferior language but not the superior one
I don't need to know it's ins and outs
It's an inferior language
It doesn't have to be

So get fucked

It would be
That phrase is technically not grammatically correct
U know what
Get fucking got
Nay thee
He didn't even know what foreskin meant
How would u know?
Otherwise idk
Menlo
My dad prolly wouldn't even want me hanging out with friends that often if the school closed cuz he's super cautious
It will be v annoying
But if school closes for like more than a week or two straight
I can afford to miss a dance
Not prom
Something just came to mind lmao
I don't want school to close
Fuck nvm
Wait
If school could just close for a while
Kinda expected that Tbh
You've never played plague Inc
It's a win win
Idk, it's not my fucking money
I get to have a legitimate excuse to skip out on ap tests
Bro that's perfect lmao
Do u get the joke tho
With the shit she pulls on us sometimes
I'm kinda paranoid
Idk man
She never said it in such a strict manner before tho
No
She's usually not this strict about making us take essays with 7s
Hmm
The synthesis that she told us to not forget
...
Seems like we're gonna do something with the physical copies
She was so adamant about not forgetting it
Do yall think we'll be doing some type of essay rewrite or something
Wait
And mentally absent doesn't count
Bruh I'm not aadithyaa
It'd be sus to just have 12 absences in a row
I mean I wasn't absent for them
O I gotta copy down all the journals
O fuck I gotta read the short story

Because
So I consider it a dub
But smaller in scale than normal
I made a small fuckup
I got mine
Read it
Isekai quartet lmao
O fuck
What?
Imagine taking a language ur not native ton
Spanish dance?
Wat
O fuck this steamed bun is hot
To be lynched
R u looking
Oliver
Gonna start my 7th tmr
It was 6th rewatch
Anime
Time to get started on my work
Emotionally obliterated
Finally finished my movie
Gotem
Unlike ur mum
Eliminate the risk
Nah just exterminate him
I have meat shortage for lunch tmr
O no
U*
Ur sick too I turd
Can u see the questions?
O
I prolly only need 15 minutes
Halp with cs
@Anaani Muss can we call at 9
I will bet u wills ownership for that $1
Get nah'd
I nah ur nah
Amen
Unstable
Something like that
Don't overthink it
Psych is really simple
Mmhm
That's all u need to know
Labels produce bias
Because they were labeled as abnormal
Lmao
It'd be unfair to call them bad because they failed at something that was almost impossible
U can't blame even professionals for that
I mean it's prolly impossible to tell if a good actor is pretending a disorder
It's that because they were labeled with whatever, it took a while for them to change their minds
It's not that they couldn't tell ppl apart
That's human bias
Bruh lmao
What
And it took a while for them to convince the professionals they were normal
Prolly the one about how ppl reported one symptom despite not having it and fooled the ward or whatever into putting them in
Something about bias
But it's too long
I actually like reading this textbook
Slides
Tho I kinda wanna study for a little
I should be all set for tmr
Did lecture notes earlier too
Not super worried
I usually don't have any problems with frq and vocab
I'm just gonna do that
Or I could skip out on studying psych vocab
Great
Now ima be sleep deprived tmr
Solving all triangles took me longer to learn than I thought it would.
Vectors look like a bit of a hassle to learn
Huh
Which is ez game
And find like one website that says companies exploit workers
My group just has to fix up conclusion tmr in flex
Gonna have to edit it later
I left it to any group member who wanted to do it
I didn't write the conclusion
We basically just told them to find the quotes we wanted and did everything else
Lmao
I feel kinda bad cuz Robert and I didn't give our group mates much to do
Then it will be better
Personify the earth as an anime girl
And everyone has the same thesis anyways lmao
So not my fault
Will just finished his rn
I mean I wrote my thesis when we just started the thing in class
Wat
Hehe
Straight up copied Steinbeck style
See that little brain thing in there?
Man is a social animal. Humans evolved to support each other and conquered the world with their empathetic brains. Brains which value predictability, brains that always look to plan. Overtime, this need for certainty supplanted empathy as man grew estranged from his evolutionary roots, and figures of cash became the most reliable source for food, joy, and success in modern society. By rewarding selfishness with monetary gain, Capitalism corrupts and supplants basic human sensibilities.
Not that long
I kept my intro to five/six lines
Ur thesis is exactly like mine now lmao
Then I'm gonna have u help me
Just waiting for my time of need in compsci or something
I helped u on multiple, multiple essays
But yes
U will be even more in debt to me than u already r
Ez
"capitalism bad"
Go 2 word
Beta
3 words
Bruh
Robert and I kinda high jacked the group ngl
Ts were about destroying empathy with selfishness and hoarding
Basically
Replacing basic human sensibilities with wealth
There was a little something extra to it
This class went quick
Damn
And then we donezo
13 then 14
@Kiran Suresh did u realize we only have two units left?
This is a start
I actually sat down at my desk and moved my keyboard
Hishb
So many slides to get through today
Time to get down to psych notes
Y would u?
I don't think so
Gotem
Or that ur slow, for that matter
Not my fault that ur wifi is slow
Quality was bad
I remember trying to discord vc u
It's prolly ur shitty wifi
Yup
No, it's just that ur mentally slow
Get sniped
Calumny, I say
This is literal slander
Will
Quit capping
That's cap
Nick is not relevant
U actually disgust me
I never said that
U have a dirty mind
Will
For what?
Flex
Nice
Not a strike
Gotem
I sense a disturbance in thine mother
I will be
I think I'll learn my math unit tmr
But my next task is psych notes
Well rn I'm just in bed with my headphones on chilling
I am satisfied cuz now I can move on to other work
v nice
aight im done studying
hmm
wonder if i knew anyone like that
inclined to waste time and lag behind
and is of questionable quality when compared to the rest of the series
which had apocrypha as part of its name
im gonna remember apocryphal by this one anime i watched
then move n to psych
time to study for 20 minutes
because i will miss the word bank and die
is the fact that u will still get a better grade than me regardless
the only irony i see
he doesnt deserve them

gotem
ur mum
HECK
ahem
frick u buddy
ew
ur eating @Will Liang?
im eating a squirrel
no
this pigeon is amazing
i will do that
smh
weak
no it was yesterday
or wait
ima finish the movie i started two days ago
so he did well all things considered
well he isnt really a native speaker
o ic
i was nowhere close lmao
that's @Will Liang
wot
ye
so i guess it didnt actually challenge me that greatly
i always had the ability to wing chinese semester finals and get 90's somehow
otherwise im happy to be lazy
if i meet a challenge i change
lmao
but look where i am in the american school system
tho that was mostly cuz of lack of effort
i mean i was a smart kid but never top of the class
so i suspect the median chinese kid would be better academically than the median american kid
chinese school is more rigorous tho
i cant interpret this coded message
what
not very smart
indian nationalism
but look at indian ppl in india
lots of successful indian ppl overseas
just like india
china's average intellegence isnt that different from any other country
lmao
they wouldnt be known as smart if they were common
but i acted and screwed around with kids the teachers saw as more delinquent types
cuz i was one of the "smart" kids
i was kinda the odd one out tho
its more like everyone knew what group they belonged to
now that i think of it the groups werent that rigid
actually i say that but there was a lot of intermingling
everyone got along except for a few people
at least back in elementary school
they usually dont intermingle much in terms of close friendships
there r pretty rigid groups/tiers within a chinese student body
that was the test i felt so bad about lmao
the friends part was just reinforcement
which was the main factor
i mean i also got a 70 something score on the first test
but they ended up liking my friends
my grandparents and mom also had a talk with me just to make sure i knew what i was doing hanging out with them
it was kinda funny ngl
both my teachers kinda looked out for me cuz of my friends
lmao
so she ended up really liking me despite thinking my choice in friends was questionable
but then i got like 90's on every test after the first two
a while after the fact i found out my teacher figured me to be a failure cuz i hung out with the kids who werent academically successful
cuz it got me hella motivated for the next test
that's prolly the most important moment for me in terms of academics
figured hed yell at me but didnt
he just told me to do better next time
told my grandpa out of shame
this one time i did incredibly bad on a test back in china and i felt really bad about it
i do best when no one tries to tell me what to do
because until i yelled at my mom then had a talk with her she was kinda overbearing too
lmao
i wouldnt have turned out as well if my grandparents hadnt raised me
tbh and not to be mean to my parents
but fully raising isnt rare
they usually just help tho instead of fully raising the grandkid
its not uncommon
its kinda a thing for chinese grandparents to raise grandkids
my dad usually doesnt know until quarter reports or semesters end
my mom checks my grades like once a month or so
lmao
which is how my grandparents raised me
she just trusts me to get stuff done
its less that my mom has given up on me
lmao
kind of a ritual
she just does it
i dont think my mom really thinks ill change my behaviour much
lmao
it's the same stuff so ive just learned to ignore it
and my mom always nags me about gaming and watching too much stuff
but they mostly leave me alone
my dad occaisionally tries to tell me what to do and my mom nags me from time to time if she sees my grades dipping
could someone share quizlet again
*nobody tell him*
Smh
Kiran has lost his prom date to some girl
Ez
Boom
He just needs to buy a body pillow
Yeah, that's what I've been telling him
How do u handle being so much more powerful than them
Having more prom dates than the rest of the falcon hacks organizers combined
How do u feel
Oliver
Get rekt
Haha
Gotem
Ur
With 5 being sung by white ppl
Actually wait after today I think I have 10nenglish songs
Only two of my English songs is sung by a white person iirc
One of the English songs is from an anime
Loli Stalin
The other one is sung by Japanese va's
One of which is military propoganda
I still have two Russian songs
And some Japanese and Korean music
So now I have like 5 English songs
But I went on a campaign to diversify my Playlist
It used to be like 95%
My Playlist is like 85% Chinese music
I listen to cpop
I meant listening to music
Lmao
Wait when Neil tried to call me out for watching anime
Bruh
It's ptsd lmao
So whenever he sees me with a hoodie he thinks I have earbuds in
He's paranoid about it now
I mean I haven't done it in a little while
He kinda does
Dagen really doesn't give much of a shit either
Which is weird
Lipman is like the only teacher I have who cares
I usually read or copy math hw in that class and she doesn't really care
It's not like it really helps me or takes away from the class
I always listen to music in that class
Cuz I like my headphone monitor setup more than a shitty little laptop screen
So I can watch more anime at home
I've been doing hw instead
I mean I haven't watched anime in classes for a while
But that's what makes her great
She's a little too nice for her own good
I mean I'm not wrong
I like her a lot
She's like the type who's so nice that it isn't that hard to take advantage of them
She's really good natured
Rozelle was pretty distressed about it
It's just reading comprehension
I rely on stimulus to learn stuff
Wait y is stimulus so hard for yall?
That test just had little more stimulus
Lmao
Wait that's hella sus
Idc if it's dumb for them to feel bad, I just care if they feel bad lmao
Preventative measures r always good even if they're imperfect
I mean if I don't disclose they have nothing to judge and feel bad about in the first place
Don't wanna make anyone feel bad about what they were able to do
Idk, someone might feel bad about it
But I'm just inside my own head space so I don't really think about it until someone brings it up
It looks like I'm just flexing
Lmao
I should prolly not mention my personal goals in terms of letter grades to anyone anymore...
Lmao
Just kinda disappointed that I got lower than usual
I mean I don't really care about the grade
Lmao
Cap
History is like the one thing I can rely on
I'd take that grade in any other class outside of history and math
It's my bar for history
Hehe
The sex number
Haha
Rip
O
I kinda rely on stimulus lmao
Like 84% or something
It was a mid low B
I got clapped too lmao
Wait I got the same grade as u last time didn't I
So I should get my same results
I pulled the same clown shit I usually do

That's what ur supposed to do
And will
Ethan should be banned from making bad grade jokes
*gets 97
D for dagen
Might as well drop to a D
If my grade is dropping to a C tmr cuz of essay
Aight bet
So it looks as if it's stretched over their face
Whose skin dried out
Like one of those mummies
He looks like he's been preserved
Not gonna be a total clown
But I don't want to risk it
I could just study for that in classes tmr
I did more than my share for the dagen thing
But fuck math
Except for math
Most of my stuff is due Wednesday
Imagine even thinking that
*gets
Famous last words
Yall ready for both our apush grades and dagen grades to drop by a letter tmr?
Making fun of an illiterate man like that
So condescending
Smh
This is discrimination and bullying
I'm illiterate
No
It's more like an aggressive reprimand
I yell in a very civilized way
Hey
It seems like our dictator @Ethan Kuo doesnt want him back
I assumed he threw a fit or something
No one planned to kick him, he just left
Nah
Iirc
Cuz someone said they didn't like his joke
O he left
Fulton time
I tired it in with monetary certainly in my intro
Yeah she did say that
Also do we plan to let aadithyaa back on or nah?
Y tf this ad so good

Flat is Justice set your nickname to Uncultured.
Depends on how I feel

Ima copy down my math in psych tmr
I mean I have math hw, but fuck math hw
This is weird
And I'm done with all my hw
It's not even 9 30
Wow
Works like a charm
Just stop being lonely by buying this one special pillow
More prom dates than the rest of the falcon hacks coordinates combined?
Looks like he's romantically successful
He likes it there
Nice
No he's mentally impaired
Gotem
Just like my grades

Said Indian teen was quoted as saying "I had a dream that I wouldn't make aime, and some strange old man in the alleyway told me I'd succeed if I just murdered a bunch of children"
This just in: Indian teen massacres kindergarten
Has aadithyaa become the very thing he swore to destroy?
Wait a second
Hmm.. M
Getting offended about nonsense jokes
Does that sound familiar to anyone?
Hmm
So he got offended cuz someone didn't like his nonsense jokes
Lmao
Wait y did aadithyaa leave again?
Mere mortal
I am above ur laws
Frickity heck
Gotem
Ur mum
Hey guess what
Therefore u r superior
Cuz u didn't negatively impact
That means u did more work
If adding more shit is negative
Wait
Nice
Lmao
He should know better
He's know me for almost two years now
I honestly don't understand
Y did he do that
Lmao
Ah you got me there
I am above rules

Maybe we should just go with the malice of the melons
Who wants to kick will? Say aye
Let's vote kick will

That's some double meaning stuff right there
Cuz they're looking to settle in California
I feel like settles might be nicer
Wait I thought it was settles

One dagen assignment
Will looking into gamer girl bathwater?
He's so funny when he gets pissed at nothing tho
I wouldn't risk it

Fucking run
Tim got pissed at me for using too many words in the presentation but then concepts aren't that hard lmao
I was working on bio
What is this whole argument
What's going on lmao
Wait
Guys
Hol up
Damn gotem
What
I've literally never stopped watching this show
Gonna start my 7th rewatch of it after I finish it today
Is too good
The show means too much to me to do that
Either one will take me about one and a half hours before I start the next
Or the other way around
Should I start working on bio presentation now and finish my show later
That was good
Heh
Cuz u were so clueless as to when prom was
Remember when u guys put it on prom day
Gg
O ic
I thought the phrase was spitting image
Wait
Thank God i realized I didn't like reds
I was thinking of buying one of those before I settled for blues iirc
Hyperx keyboards
Lmao
What
But it's so much less tedious if I split little rest periods in between modules
This psych outline kinda taking forever
Flat is Justice set your nickname to Trapped.
He got
Will isn't cultured
Ray set her own nickname to flat is justice.
Girl
Tumbleweed
Best song

Worked out fine
And given who my group members were, it was the correct expectation
I just expected my group to do that for me
Well u can't expect that of me
Making the decisions to cut or not to cut
Yeah, we were playing the role of the director for that one
It asked us for like the ed songs, plot points and stuff
Didn't have anything to do with the director
Wait it was just plotting out a new movie
Lmao
Like at all
We never did anything related to that
Wait tf
But we never did anything related to a letter to the director
We did that thing where we "planned" the movie
Letter to the director?
What?
Scrolling through my google news feed I didn't really see a single positive thing lmao
Director thing?
Ur welcome
This pear is amazing
Mmm
I should win it
If there was an award for avoiding productiveness
I never got beyond 4k as a level 9
Mmhmm
It ain't fun for a level 7
Cuz when u keep facing level 11/12
I've stopped playing tho
No one seems to know how to run against lavaloon
I'm running lavaloon
Ikr
I'm a level 7 at 4100
Clash is actually so ez now lmao.
Everybody disliked that
Got immediately fucked by Chinese readers for being retarded
Some news station said the poetry was out of touch and inappropriate
Japan sent us some free medical supplies with ancient Chinese poetry on it to support the effort
The league of nations :o
The axis powers: no
The league of nations: plz stop killing ppl and conquering other nations
Get an intern and abuse them instead
Road roller is better

The promised neverland
I still haven't found another show that can replicate it
God tier
K on actual top tier
Ye
An emotional one
OK ben
Its just about taking a trip
Lmao
K on isn't about the story tho
The show is prolly my favorite show out of everything I've watched
Welp
I've watched it about once a month since my first watch I think
7th time I think?
The show that I'm about to reach for the
K on
Bruh lmao
I don't want to stumble onto another k on dojinshi
So I stay away
But I'm too scared of the site
Apparently there's some pretty quality stuff on there that can be considered actual stories instead of porn
That was a trip
I used a random number generator to create six digit codes this one night
There r worse out there
I'm the grand scheme of things that one isn't that bad
Chinese peoples
The catholic church agrees
Never got past season 2
It was enough to get me to stop watching the show lmao
The three commandments
And thighs
Flat is justice
The other two r
Well one of the three
That is the golden commandment
Lolis r for headpats, not lewds
Went from antianime to cultured weeb very quickly
I was never a weeblet
Never developed a taste for it
Like twice
NH is scary
Tho I haven't gone on hh in the last three years now
Many of them r like fanfics, so I stay away
U plug in the six digits into the link, and u will receive the corresponding hentai Manga
In the case of nhentai, they're all hentai
Or self published manga
Which is all hand drawn doujinshi
nhentai.net
Six digits comes from nh
Six digits
Which is cool
Hh is hentai videos
See
Completely different
Nope
Lmao
Not videos
It's a different website
Lmao
No it isn't
Wait
Very good website obviously, it's a .org domain
Ur welcome
hentaihaven.org
I'm about to enculture this man a little bit
Alright
Do u know what HH stands for will
Wait
What
The most cultured site
Yes ofc
Tho idk if hh counts as a porn site
Brazzers, pornhub, xhamsters, hh, whatever
Like 4 I of the biggest ones I think
Xhamsters was blocked
Then I decided to try out every site I could remember
Which worked
Then someone tried posting the pornhub link.
So he couldn't send it
But it was apparently blocked by messenger
I forget y
So abhishek tried to post a porn site
Ok
What the fuck is going on with messenger rn
Y is my chat history here removed from dio Brando up to the whole porn sites thing
Wait
Gotem gotem
Nay thee
Ur about as unpredictable as cabbage
We all know ur just gonna say it's up his ass or something
Fatherless biped
It's a plucked chicken

Cuz coronavirus I think
Ye
Maybe I should buy into Intel now...
Intel amd and nvidia stocks be falling rn
Hmm
I hope it knows what it needs
Not like I consciously control my naps
It's what my body gives me
And on and off resting in math
Prolly 20 minutes at home
30 minutes in compsci
Maybe it's because I've been taking naps that my body is giving me less sleeon
Bruh
But I'm fully awake now
Or at least I wanted another hour
I needed one more hour
What the fuck
Great
My body woke me up at 6 40
Welp
He'd stick it in
If it is carbon based
Actually
Or just appendages in general
He'd stick it in anything that has legs
O @Aadithyaa Sridharbaskari r u going to prom
Then I'd sleep in psych prolly
If I do I will be very pissed at no one in particular
Hopefully I don't wake up at 6 30
I've been doing that instead of sleeping

Lying in bed thinking about stuff
Lying in bed?

Gotem
Will is my lower bound
No
No
Hehe
By tanked I mean I got the same Mc score as will
So ur prolly higher rn lmao
I mean I got tanked for not putting in even the minimum effort I usually do
Just sun urself
U should get a C
And the ability to keep a constant body temperature
If u have the ability to interpret the English alphabet
Wait but actually
It's not hard to keep a B lmao
Just never read and never actually write anything?
How would u even get a D
Honestly
Can't relate
Instead of a C
Imagine expecting you'd get a B in dagen
Heh
Quick flex about how u weren't worried about B in dagen
We r on opposite ends of the spectrum of spedness
Yes so u might not want to listen to me on this either
So his might not be the best opinion when regarding any type of history
Will is historically sped
Lmao
Physics is obviously gonna be harder
Wait
The same one Dennis joined lmao
We turned it into apush
The old ap world discord
Alphabet soup and a few court cases
Cuz that's all I need
I'm gonna dig for the alphabet soup
It's on the discord
It looks like it

Wow
Didn't even know yall were making them before today lmao
Time to use these study guides
Time to start studying apush
Vulgar lies

Yup
Bruh evolution is false
The trial was of a great scope
They put a scope on trial
Promenade

I ain't gonna give no F to them lmao
The fact that not a single college is gonna want them now, that is
That's kinda funny
I legitimately don't remember if I fell asleep or not, and not enough time passed for me to be sure that I didn't just space out for a little
But idk if I actually took a nap
So climbed into bed for a nap
I was gonna start studying but felt tired
Yup
We earnestly thank thee
And thy social security number

School is a net positive for multiple reasons
I actually like most of my classes, so school is a net positive for me
Fridays have everything I could ever want
Instead of just gaming
Imagine having to work on Fridays
Fridays r goated

Thursday is good
Wednesdays r utter garbage
Tuesdays r ok
Mondays r good

There's just nothing I can look forwards to on a Wednesday
I dislike Wednesdays in general Tbh

U didn't snipe me
It was always a gentle downhill slope
I never peaked
Quick flex

"Jews... are bad... And... Evil" (Ben Shapiro, 2019)

The water was kinda cold
I could describe my dishwashing instead
No one uses that
I don't use that
U don't use that
Cortana actual garbage
Lmao.
Imagine not being able to shoot with any precision
Imagine having to swipe instead of tap or scroll.
Imagine not being able to control volume without ur keyboard or screen
It scrolls right
Tilt the wheel right
The mouse scrolls left
Tilt ur scroll wheel left
Will ur actually retarded lmao
Bruh
Pause/play music, change volume
U could do everything with my old mouse
Move mouse wheel left and right to scroll left and right
That's a feature on my old mouse
By moving the mouse wheel, sure
Still shitty compared to mice
Lmao
Top notch track pad
Bruh I have a surface laptop.
Mice feel objectively better
Track pads just kinda feel shitty too
Gl shifting ur mouse by frantically scooting ur finger across

Will
@Will Liang read my fucking thing

He did not write those numbers
He does not use digits
0/10
I don't remember Steinbeck using those words
Send me urs
If u can read it now I'll share
I've just been asking u lmao
Bruh
How about we make it 300 points ec
Yes
Just cuz
Except for @Will Liang
Amd everyone should get an A
Everyone in dagen will have an equal poem
Therefore
Steinbeck's words = Steinbeck's words
Our poems = Steinbeck's words
Since our poems r all from Steinbeck's words
Hey
Read my stupid poem
@Will Liang
So who is being mathematically clowned
Fs

Flat is Justice set the nickname for Anaani Muss to Premkumn.
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Anaani Muss to Premkun.
She said no essay yeah
But zayn is a nicer name
Not gonna bother looking up either
So I guess zayn
Zayn is a nicer name than Kelly imo.
Age is just a number
If u somehow haven't noticed
Bad jokes r indeed by specialty
Hence, u r a spectrum
Ur so far off the deep end of the spectrum they had to make a new one for u
Cuz u made me explain that joke
Which makes sense
The spectrum
It means ur on a spectrum
Gotem
Unlike u
10 is not
18 is legal
Bruh lmao
OPEN UP
FBI
Dumbo
Look at his age
Can't relate
Imagine having an imagination
Imagine not having a clock on ur book

Imagine having to turn pages
Disgusting
Imagine having a paper book
Imagine having a book that can be ripped or torn
Yes, imagine
Can't relate
Imagine
Imagine having a book that can rip and tear
Lmao

Utility?
I'm superior
I stare at a thinking hunk of rock
Quit acting dense

That doesn't help
How many times do I have to say
Dude

Lmao
That tells me literally nothing
Don't remember that one
What's fruit one?
Chapter 5 is quality
Then I just kept reading to pick up new words that fit the framework I had set up
Just collected words for the first few pages and started writing with what I had
But I didn't go through the whole chapter
I started off by doing that
Writing that was quick
Huh
Most kyoani properties also ages well in terms of animation outside of the ones as old as or older than Haruhi
It's aged really well
Kill la kill was great too
Holy fuck heaven's feel
And the heaven's feels movies
So good
Bruh kyoani art too
That movie was great
Fire show
@Abhishek Koul u should watch kill la kill
But I've been too busy getting through newer stuff
I need to watch them.
Ghibli movies r fire
One of my favorite shows has the most hidden and slow fucking plot ever and I love it
Some of the shows I watch have such a slow and hidden plot that they seem to just not have a plot
Not my type of thing
But I doubt I'll watch death note
Prolly will watch the ghibli films one day
Haven't watched either
Never really tried soap operas
I'm into slice of life anime
But for now nichijou is what I'm watching, and Jojo
I'll pick it up again someday
I kinda dropped that
Slow stories allow fully fleshed out character development
I love slow shows
What's wrong with slow shows
I'm gonna watch parasite someday
No
Ben
Suspense and horror aren't my thing
Never got into horror, prolly never will
Hot
I gotta get pc parts
Bruh
My $50 diver watch is perfect for me
Not looking to but a new watch
With a little led bar
It's just a normal watch

But at one point in a man's life
I'd like to say no
Ugh
Ab

Not that

Look what I found
https://www.tblop.com/

Mofos. Com
Lmao
O I couldn't send it either
Mofos
Lmao
He's just @Geoffrey Xiang's imaginary waifu
No
Just out of nowhere @Geoffrey Xiang says "hey Eddie you're pretty hot."
It was so good.
Skit
Yall weren't there for his slang slit
What @Geoffrey Xiang did tho
Do it
Give me something to make fun of
Yes
That plan fell through
I was gonna finish my apush outline today
They bag each other
Lips aren't the best tho
Ur just uncultured
I see lips
All r equal in the eyes of the lord

There's a pair of lips there too
Ray set her own nickname to Flat is justice.
God damn it Ben
But sure?
I feel like ur gonna give me hentai
Um
Worked out fine
I tried making a stick figure
Lmao.
He just gives u the points
Wait
Quick question
Hey
Then I prolly wouldn't talk to him as much
I wish Kiran was a girl
Maybe it's the sugar
The color of this soy milk is a little different
Gotem
Ur mum
Cuz
Will is a bully
O add me there
Implicated in what
Report to who lmao
Makes sense
Wait that's actually true lmao.
We do shit like that all the time
Lmao
Do u know how the ppl in school know us
Bruh
That's a little mean lmao
What
Lmao
Other ppl don't exist
Nope
Who's will
No need to be offended by that
Unlike u I have a sense of humor
Yes aadithyaa
Good joke unless if they send it out
Lmao
OK buddy
For making a joke?
That's the joke
It's not
I'd prolly still make fun of u even if it looked good
If it makes u feel better
That is the question
Yes but how does it look on u
So I wanna know if it looks retarded
Abhishek changed
Just like mine
Ur hairstyle is always the same
Shou
Show
I want to see ur hair
Bully
He admits it
See
Too intimidating
Will flexes his pencil skills to bully
Will is bully

Kiran and I both got minor clapped
Hella names
Study for psych
@Robert Gan
Cuz ur unworthy
You're approaching me?
Oh hoho
Mmhmm
INDECENCY
REEEEEE
ANKLES
Fucking
Are those
Bro
India only 20 million behind China now.
Not even a billion
Was around 500 mil
That the Chinese population during ww2
It's so weird
It works out
If u literally have more ppl than they do bullets
And they'll run out of bullets
Throw enough people at them
The ussr way of fighting wars
It's military
O nvm
Does that not?
China more than 3 mil
Russia lost 2.7 mil
That numbers kinda cap
Wait
What
That's
Lmao
Cmon
Send Pic of hair
@Abhishek Koul
Ur cap
I was thoroughly outplayed
Damn
Who else could 'e be
Why he's prem
Prem?
Damn prem
No u
Nah
So fun
Xcom 2
God
U did not have to share that
Ugh
What
Spotify just found a whole stash of jpop
Ah shit
But it's straight up propaganda
I love the song
I don't think I was, idk
"the red army is the strongest"
One of my songs is literally Soviet propoganda lmao
Wait
I got hella movie songs too actually
Mmhmm
Some might be without my knowledge
Not that way at least
I don't think I have anyone sus in my Playlist
Damn
To be successful and not get clapped
Just have to support the govt
They're not sus
Can't be a successful Chinese artist without getting tied to the govt
I'd have to clear so much out of my Playlist
If I didn't separate my music from my artists
When Kiran disliked
Lmao
Ppl don't care about male victims lmao.
Mmhmm
She's prolly not gonna get clapped or anything tho
She's not getting any sentencing right
Wow
A finger
I heard something like that
O she abused him didn't she
Lmao
Documentary
How bad r we talking here?
R Kelly was the pedo right
Ew
Ugh
I feel like I could prolly run for a while under the sun
But less due to my heat and more due to how unfit I was
I tried to run a mile a day in the summer back in China once, it was kinda death
Tho idk how long I can keep up a run during the summer
I'm used to doing everything in high heat
The cold makes my legs all cramped and shit
Tho I have run till I felt like I was overheating before
Yo I cannot run in the cold lmao
Is a sacrifice
And I can't enjoy a good show as much if I watch while running
But I don't wanna buy headphones just for running
Cuz I have a hard time focusing on the anime sometimes when the running gets going
I could prolly get the same effect with just music
Gg
Mmhmm
Then the anime doesn't help as much
Unless if I'm dying as I am during hiit stuff
Treadmills r easier and anime helps a ton
Mmhmm
It'd be a lot harder without the anime
I just watch anime while running lmao
It's on a treadmill and I watch anime while doing it
Usually a range between 5-7
6 miles on average
Fucc
And now I'm too full to run
Had a snack
I was hungry at 5
OPEN UP
FBI OPEN UP
AY
Ay
Beautiful
Monk *
Become Buddhist mono
Go bald
Ay send a Pic when ur done
So idk what any of this means
I've only changed hairstyle once
The first one looks like a weird mushroom
Just cut ur hair a little shorter

Ay someone do some speed photoshop
Idk how you'd look with them
Either lmao
Go bald
Bruh
I cannot see u with that hair
Wait actually?
This is what culture looks like

Oliver is here
Ooo
Prem

R u serious
Will
Wait
Bruh
...
I'll finish second half
Kiran wrote the first half
Lmao
I have the paper
Just point out three things in depth
I don't plan to write that much
Gonna be around 4/5 prolly
Currently 2/5 of a page
I need to finish mine in a bit
Nice
Ima read that
Where was I when that happened
Heavily hinted?
Cultured *
No
Gotem
Ur mum
Anyone in rozelle psych have the napoleon dynamite thing
Just cuz it ain't my worst doesn't mean I'm willing to put myself through it
But I don't want to do it anyways
No it can't
I'd be scared of that
Actually idk what could possibly top some of the stuff I've seen
I've prolly seen worse but still
I must decline for my own sake
None of them will make for a good read
It'll only be to my loss
I am not checking them out
No
Das kinda dum dum but OK
Bruh
Lmao
Whoever uses gow for grapes of wrath
What
Tho I guess it could be beastiality or something, idk
Son/father
Cuz u said God of War
Just ask him about six digits
Brian would know
Ur too innocent to understand will
Out of here
Very hard nope.
Hard nope
So incest/pedophilia
Ugh
Wait
I forget what gow stands for anyways
No
I refuse
Fuck u
No
I ain't checking it out
It's prolly k on
Don't them them digits at me
Everything that could go wrong did go wrong for me
Can't relate
Imagine not having a shitty three day weekend
Time to start reading chapter 20
I should start reading 20 soon
Gotem
Ur mum
That's a drawing
That's not a picture
No
I'm in this book and I don't like it
I, too, scout for young boys
I have transitioned from your mom jokes
Gotem
That's what she said
Kinda tired.
I should sleep...
Thx tho
That's common sense lmao
Well yeah
Ubi flip neg to win.
Hmm?
No need for me to bring up names
It's resolved
Dw about it
No
The man is a living contradiction of an extremely high magnitude
Can't blame them, they're freshmen so they still gotta learn
It was meant to be a joke apparently but it came off as extremely toxic
Toxicity regarding records
It's more gay cuz we're all guys
Yeah no that's not how it works lmao
Be more mindful
We just had a whole talk earlier in debate too
Cmon
Dude take it into dms
Will is a special child
I cannot tell with that man
Idk about will
Except will
I mean no one is gonna judge u for jacking off lmao.
We don't need to hear about it
Yeah but that type of question should be for dm
Tho we all know the answer u should prolly go into dm
That escalated quickly
Well
Nice
A two in one
It's appetite was too big
Should've gone for it
Solo but still
Mile high club?
I just like listening to music while ppl lecture
I just wish he was a little more like rozelle in that she doesn't care about me having one earbud in
Lippers is great
I've got enough
I wouldn't mind
This man bouta do the sex offender shuffle.
Lmao
He asked her if I paid any attention to her or just watched anime
Wait when lippers found out I was dating
Lmao
Bold of u to assume I care about ppl roasting me
It means it was a mistake
And it was too late
Didn't even realize I'd fucked up until I was halfway there
So I just automatically did it then and there
I usually do it in math the period after
Wait I wasn't thinking of it lmao
So I don't pay attention to him
Through no fault of his own he has nothing to teach me
I'm fs disrespectful towards my math teacher tho.
I just like listening to music
For obvious reasons
Not while watching anime tho
And I don't think of it as disrespectful since I'm still paying attention while listening to music
Mmhmm
Chill is just relaxing and not really caring
Wait I haven't even been doing either for the past few weeks lmao
Ye lmao
Well then just Lang
O they do?
I am kinda surprised by how chill everyone outside of apush and Lang think I am tho
Sitting and goofing off in most of ur classes without caring much about the teacher is under one of the definitions of chill
Getting offended is not under any of those definitions
Well not chilling cuz it's nice and warm here
I'm the person chilling in bed
I'm not the person getting offended here
?
Wait I'm the person who needs to learn that the least lmao
O shit my kindle. Is on now
Or learn how to double click space less
Maybe I need to. Turn off this period thing from swiftkey
I just. Thought it was funny
Chill.
Lmao
Whose fault is that
I just need to hold an A first sem
I don't need an A second sem
Well thing is
Gg
Well no shit lmao
So I'll just do ap Chem
And rather take ap than normal.
Just want to take Chem in hs
Nah
Just want to learn some Chem
None.
Cuz I didn't wanna take Normal Chem
That was Fulton Dennis
I wanted to go out of hs taking Chem but normal Chem. Is a dud
Cuz I put Calc bc and ap Chem in same year
Lmao
I kinda fucked up
Wait next year is gonna be harder than this year for me.
Psych is nice class.
Wat
Wait it's legit good.
No
The grapes of wrath
U heathen
Very deep
Worth a good read
Indeed
For the sacred texts
The sacred number
When will it live again
Fuck my kindle still dead
Gotem
That's what she said
Gotem
For just a little while
I think it's time to put my your mom jokes to rest
Gotem
Nah, I've seen ur mum.
Tho I mostly ss will
Screenshot *
Lmao
We screen's hot everyone
My kindle be ded
Fuck
Aadithyaa y u so defensive rn lmao
But becoming a porn cameraman instead
Imagine studying film to fulfill ur dreams of making a movie or something
Ik u don't watch it for the women
U should know that
Wait porn is not majority female
Is it?
Wait nursing isn't a major
Nursing?
I bought a ebook so now I don't need the actual book
O I should find where I am on my kindle
Mmm
I'd dip math every chance I get
Math is boring
Aside from math
I just like my schedule and school life so I'd rather go than dip.
I mean u don't have to go to school if u can get away with it
Y would u want to lmao
That's actually kinda sad lmao
Wait
But just dip from math to read or something
I like my other classes so I'd still show
Then I wouldn't have to go to math anymore
I wish my parents could care so little
Y do ur parents care so little.
U showed up for almost every dagen period lmao
That was great
I used debate to skip math once
The American education system gave me that
I had it since middle school
I'm just waiting for prom to happen now
I'm checked out this year
I've already got senioritis
Bold of u to assume he isn't already consumed
Lost like 7 rounds on the way there
So I used it to bump my level 7 acct to 4100 trophies ez
I just know no one knows how to counter it anymore
Y did it fall out of the meta
Whatever happened to lavaloon
Lavaloon stan
Is that legal, my lord
Wow
U really
Damn Ethan
Wincest
Gotem
Like his sister
And there is less empirical evidence for the sun rising in the morning than certain physics experiments
There is less empirical evidence for u needing sleep than there is for the sun rising in the morning
Peak comedy
Indeed
Gotem
Ur mum
Then read until I sleep
Gonna listen to this song one more time
I need to read
Weak
Aside from Chinese
I don't recognize the other languages she uses to say the word love
Didn't even notice that the first few times I heard it
That's pretty neat
This song uses the word for love in both Korean and Japanese
Huh
O
Ray set her own nickname to .

The more lasting opponent of the new deal
Lmao

I mean I gotta finish my outline first
I think ima go to wills to do my outline
Bruh
Jesus
Y now of all times
Ima take a nap and then read I guess

Lmao
Not like I care

Does me fine
Well idc
Now I can't listen to music either

But my empiric of 104 is more recent than his
I scraped by with 90.6
Lmao
Did u get A last sem
Graydon
Guess she doesn't know 75>43
Their impact was 43 million
Impact is 75 million
We also won medicaid
Fuck her
Like actually
Our judge was mentally retarded
So how will u solve poverty if u urself say infra is gonna die
Like u literally can't solve poverty without infra
Makes no sense but whatever
But we lost on poverty
They conceded that
4th round we won this contention saying infrastructure is prereq to solving poverty
And 5th round we got clapped
We got screwed 4th round
Nice city too
I like this campus
I'm at berk rn
Yes
Debate
Bruh lmao
Medicaid op
This topic is flip aff to lose lmao
@Aadithyaa Sridharbaskari our aff case actually trash
Nice correction there
I gotta talk to rozelle about it
Cuz one of my assignments missing

Mission success then
Lucky my ass
Even got a high B in biochem, even tho I didn't know any Chem
And 100 on an earlier test
I also got almost 100 on the test that came with the final
Bruh lmao
And I got over 100% on that final
Just normal studying
Tho it's not really cramming
That's what I do
U just need to cram 2 hours per chapter for bio
It's better to do 2 hours per chapter
Ye
But the tests r hard
It's an ez class
Yed
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
I just happened to find some noodles in wills lunch
Finders keepers
Hey
My noodles
Ur noodles?
Prolly not?
Idr
Mmhmm
Wat
Flat is Justice cleared the nickname for ChanYoung Ben Kim.
If u don't say no I will take it as approval
Is that a yes?
Can I draw a dick on it
Yes I think
I put leadership
Yup
Cuz this could just be high tier denial
I'm only like 70% on this tho.
I don't remember her ever testing on anything from before the prior night of reading
So u can actually skip everything until like 283 or something
She only quizzes the stuff u read the night before
When she does reading quizzes
The thing is
Wait
Can u send me code plz
...
Yeah that's what I've heard
Can u help him so I have someone to copy code from
Cuz Brian can't figure them out
R we supposed to do all of the sorts
Ay prem.
I'll catch up over weekend
I'm gonna tell myself there's no way she's giving a quiz tmr
Just gonna pray for no reading quiz tmr
And I'm already sleepy
Fucc
I got 63 pages to read
Welp
I put leadership there
Ye
Lmao
Every ameri an has that right
U can eat the bear arms at least
Yes
So issok
I still own u
Well
U implying u had any respect for me in the first place?
Today is second best day of this month
Est purchase I've ever made
Hehe
Manga feels like weird in between that fails to satisfy either of my needs
I want either book form or show form
Love live is another one
I can't read Manga for some reason
Never tried reading the Manga
Mmm
Still get a permanent spot in my Playlist
Nadeko's two ops
Mmm
I never got to watching kizu tho
Good
Yes
Problematic
V nice show
Have u watched monogatari yet
I think nichijou might start climbing up my favorites
Poor man
Nasu needed money quick tho
Return to form I guess
So
The whole franchise was spawned from what is technically kinda doujin
To be expected
...
Prolly bloom into you
I would've watched something else if we didn't have to
Wait I specifically chose illya prisma because he made us turn desks
Maybe old ghibli but they kinda ded now
Kyoani best studio
Both my favorite movies r also kyoani
4 of my 5 favorite shows r kyoani tho
That's the only show that's ever had so much fanservice that it forced me to drop it
I watched illya prisma in lipman
Yup
Cuz one of them is a whole franchise with infinite time line works
Or 5 series
It's kinda retarded that I have 5 shows tied for favorite
Ya know
Prolly has a sayori sticker
Mr K prolly low key enjoyed eromamga sensei
Fate shows r hella nice for the most part
Such a fucking show
Violet evergarden
Then I just dropped off back to kyoani
I followed Manga briefly
Yes yes I've watched all of aot
I have like 15 shows in top 5 cuz I can never decide lmao
I forget
Or was it top 3
I ended up kicking it from my top 5
Aot was OK for me
It'll be forever before I dig myself out of endless kyoani rewatches and fate spinoffs
I'm entrenched in slice of life and fate
I'll never get to it
Ez
Ex
I can take 5 aps and watch anime
Clannad still one of my 5 all time favorites
Lmao.
There's a whole ton of suffering the anime actually cut out
Knowing the lore makes the ending amazing
It's associated with the wish granting powers of the little glowing balls
I had to read a wiki article to get it
It was kinda cut out of the anime.
Do u understand the lore behind it
Wdym
Bruh the ending was amazing
As 11/10
Solid 8/10
S1 was nice
Not just S1 clannad
Wait you've watched clannad as right
Clannad is so good
Gotem
Not to be touched
Clannad characters r sacred
And fuck u for it
Yes ofc u would
They can't compare
Clannad on a completely different dimension.
But clannad
Like weathering with u was good
Infinitely worse
Bruh it's worse
Cannot be tolerated
Actual sacrilege of the highest order
Wait I'll actually Lynch u for doing that
What the fuck
That's cap
Nice
Flat is Justice cleared the nickname for ChanYoung Ben Kim.
Flat is Justice cleared the nickname for ChanYoung Ben Kim.
One of the two
283
69420
Western pig
Ass is uncultured
Lmao.
Then never had a problem after it again
And had a full blown argument with me and prem over it cuz he couldn't pull his head out of his ass.
Accused me of being insensitive for saying retard
This is the guy who in the summer
Use ublock
U rart
Imagine having ads lmao
Today was big stress Boi hours
I wanna just chill
I did 1/7 on psych outline so far
So I am neutral
I am naturally averse to kpop for these reasons, but there is a pull to the other side as well.
Good cpop is my fav
And I just prefer jpop/cpop in general
I don't like that
Like there's this one twice video where they desecrate a Soviet tank
I am neutral on kpop
Hmm
Kpop
Yang gang be gone
Mmm
Ez
Reject their rejection
I like the music I added.
I just started
Lmao
@Kiran Suresh how long did psych outline take
nice
I put in leadership lmao
It's not an option I'm pretty sure
No
Just sign up for leadership
And then in March u fill in a form saying to replace that elective with TA
Like leadership
Just put an elective in there for now
No, Prem. *
I accidentally hit the period sometimes lmao
Put in filler elective rn, apply in March
Clown.
U could pad ur grade hella
But the other tests were ez
I just didn't know unit 8
Wouldn't have been without so much unit 8
I mean psych final was hard
Ethan cmon lmao
...
Lmao
So I don't have top 5
These r the only hard classes I've ever taken.
Fulton - world - dagen
Just out of classes I've taken
Hmm
My top 5
This man be clowning
Lmao. African American lit
PE > ap world
:(
Plz make easier
PE too hard
Ap physics
PE
My rank:
Stop being sped
Not "the"
Lmao.
He said one of
Not that hard
The last two pages u could extrapolate from the vocab
Mostly
It was correct
I just know he apparently did
Bio test was a clap
Gotem
Then ima kms
If it turns out 16/18 isn't mostly vocab and he trolled us
I crammed everything I should need to cram for bio
I did it
Holy shit
The lamb was great there
I found this uighur place that's hella good in union city
If I'm stuck with burgers and shit then I feel kinda miserable lmao
If I discover something great
It makes the tournament so much more enjoyable
Greeting new food at every tournament I go to is actually so nice
I'm neutral on debate, so I do it a little for college apps, and mostly for hanging out with friends/food
I'm not touching debate in college
Mmm
And then I'm done with debate forever
Lmao
Relive my first tournament
Next year as novice
But I'll prolly ask Graydon to go with me for scu2
It could be fun
Yes I'd give u the trophy if u do
They're novices, tf they gonna do
Say they're sick or something
I have half a mind to just have someone sign up with me and just go mav
I can make myself do it but I'd rather not
And I just don't like competing too much in general
Waking up early and sleeping late, always cold
The conditions for tournaments don't suit me
Scu2 first time was hella fun but then it was kinda downhill from there
I don't like competing that much tbh
And I'll show up to scu2 as novice lmao
I'm prolly dipping after scu1 next year, I think
I won't be going to enough tourneys for toc next year anyways
Lmao
Like ever
I'm not going for toc
Ik
But Monday is gonna be great day
Ima get shafted prolly
Ye it is
If I hit silver I'll prolly dip cuz I'm done there
Berk
Lmao
Ik not scu
If I ever hit silver bid I dip
I just wanna break var and get bid
Carry will
If u do novice u can just clap
U doing novice?
It's a little early lmao
For scu2?

Great talk

I remember a Pearson question on that
O yeah
Das vocab

Fuck 15
15 was torture
Gonna skim 14 real quick to see if I gotta review something there
Chapter 13 is ez
Yes plz
Ye something like that
But 15 is death
13 is ez
Chapter 15 is death
It's that whole chunk about genes minus viruses
Genes and shit
5 is scary
5
4 is a little worrisome
I'm fine with 2 or 3
If it wasn't for the fact that this is 5 chapters I wouldn't be worried
Aadithyaa fuck u
It scares me
Cuz 5 chapter test
Yes
Gonna reread two chapters
Gotta cram more bio
Just not for apush
I'm putting my time to good use

I didn't know that
He does?
Exactly
I got 2nd period
Ha
Beta
Imagine finishing ur outline tonight
I just wanna vote with a clean conscience if I do
Not like my vote really counts lmao
If he doesn't I prolly just won't bother voting
So if he runs again ima vote for him
I actually like ubi

I opened a pdf right after I saw most ppl finished lmao
It was ma
So I put ma
And it didn't sound like something grandpa would say
So it was either pa or ma
So that ruled out all the kids
So it meant the pa was dead
It said my pa used to say
I went hella big brain to figure it out
Wait for the first question
Mmm

Blinding urself and going gf

Blind myself with acid and gf

Sir u r too brown to be ruled innocent
That's resisting arrest
Tiktok homogay
He gonna get buff like Barack Obama
For Kiran at least
Wdym, that's the incentive
This shouldn't backfire on me
He really wanted to write it so ima trust him to do it tmr
I don't think Graydon is writing our aff case rn...
https://youtu.be/eGslweDOihs
Bruh wot
Ignoring the horrible data in these fucking mountains
So I could potentially watch anime while walking
I used to read while walking
While walking maybe
What how
Ur obviously gonna be watching on a stationary TV
Like it's way too much effort to hold a phone while running
Who tf runs while watching TV
Bruh
Kiran ur actually mentally challenged
Bruh on a treadmill u rart

Everything revolves around anime
Ez
My workout plan is watching anime while running

Just waiting to help friends who r panicking on their pagtakhan essay
I finished apush outline at school
Lmao this was the song I listened to before rounds at the last tourney
Bruh

Next song in my Playlist is telephone awoo
O shoot
@Anaani Muss
Bruh
Nah cuz ur gonna take the coronavirus
Koreans too busy being beta
I remember having a beyblade battle with a friend in the middle school where we lived lmao
Or 2nd grade
I bought it in like 3rd grade
I lost it so long ago
I do not know the name of the one I had
It is the natural evolution of a country
When India became a superpower in 2020, they started rounding up their Muslims too
Nah that's just what world powers do
Or it will become one in the near future
I'm sure of it
It's a Chinese colony
That was greatv
Ye lmao
No it's a colony
Nah that's legit cap
China #1
Nah Chinese is better
Tho Tbh I don't remember anything of that show anymore
I don't know who kyoya is because I watched in Chinese
It was great
I remember buying a beyblades for 100 yuan
Mmhmm
U can't beat beyblades
Beyblades were the best
Bruh beyblades
Nah ur just rart
Bruh bakugan was the shit
Yall nerds
It will take u far in life
Listen to 
The only way aadithyaa will escape a friend zone is by getting a restraining order
@Kiran Suresh restrain ur mate
Ima die of the flu or something
I was cold even with this puffer jacket
That was it for me
I kinda died at work
Lmao
Lmao did u get clowned

Yall don't need to worry about GPA anymore
Maybe this is the coronavirus
I feel like I have a cold
I should sleep early today
Dennis 2 electric Boogaloo
Wait that's what I said to Brian lmao
Hmm
Did he really screw up some of the answers?
I got clowned
I told u lmao
Clowns
Imagine not finishing ur apush outline at school
I was too busy dying
I don't think it was those exact words but that's the gist of it
The condition is wills presence
I am a great guy conditionally
It's a double win for me
I'd be laying the groundwork for my future clinical psychologist job with how many mental illnesses that'd generate
Everyone who cares would be panicking
I would because that's funny as fuck
No more tournaments after prolly like October/November most likely
Next year ima dick around in Fulton and help out in debate
Ur just challenged, not challenging urself
Lmao imagine challenging urself in math
@Robert Gan
Yall losers
Bruh imagine needing a vapa still
McAlister
Cuz we're all being clowned
Dagen should count as a vapa
Take photography or digital art
Put a stick up ur ass and become a tree
This poll is no longer available.

Imagine needing to redo urs
@Kiran Suresh can u share narrative with Graydon

Ugh
Gonna write this 500 word essay for a summer camp and then prolly work on debate
I'm omega productive today
So more like 30 minutes
I mean for 10 of those minutes I was fucking around doing summer camp stuff
Dialogues r easier to write
Got in a call with Kiran and wrote it in 40 minutes
Mmhmm
Can't relate
Imagine being so unproductive that u couldn't even finish both dagen assignments in the same morning
Bruh will have u still not started
Poe
Stop fapping he's underage
Gotem
Pooping *
I beat Eddie at pool tho
Tho I didn't really know any of the ppl there

Eric's party

Lmao
How much of grapes of wrath do I have to read
Should study a little tonight
O shit psych vocab test Monday

@Will Liang what did u think

Aight bet

@Will Liang u wanna read my where I live thing?
@Kiran Suresh when do u wanna start doing the partner thing
Mine has a similar point in it
Hmm
Lmao
It's not mla

Lmao
I used the header trick to squeeze 2

Zeugma
I came to school and on your mom

Ima dip
Abhishek what is all this normie shit
She got so much makeup that I can't see her skin
What the fuck
Guys I have a 110% in Lang, help
Proficiency 20
Ap test score 80%
Ap test score and proficiency
The two in tandem
Or Chinese ap test score
Yo let's base power off of proficiency in Chinese
And times u swore during soc sem
Wait let's base it off soc sem participation
Mime on somewhere between 70 to 80 I think
Lmao
Aight bet
What about average reading quiz grade
Kolhberg writing dub tho
Rip.
Was Ethan part of that group?
We agree
What about whoever got highest grade on dagen kolhberg assignment
The time spent studying is inversely proportional to power
We should do it by time spent studying for apush
We should do it by apush debates ranking
Which I am fine with
And I come in third
Mmhmm
She ain't here
That seems like a fitting compromise
Whoever had the highest Fulton essay grade on the rhetoric essay
What about
American isn't an ethnicity
A to Z
How about by ethnicity
Admin on apush grade
Nah
Lmao messenger broke





This is a rebellion




I seek a reward for my volunteered work.
Bruh lmao




Flat is Justice set the emoji to .
U capping rn
And the third question is very obviously all mine cuz it's all in my handwriting
Wait u can see how I added a whole half paragraph to the second question lmao
I literally did carry that quiz lmao
The third part was all me
I had to save the second part
The first part was a split
Lmao
Wait what
That's ur own mind, I merely pointed out a fact
Hey Ethan I carried u on a test and a group assignment in dagen
Das kinda gay
Do not be blinded by power
A threat to our liberties
This is an expansion in govt
I'm lazy
In lazy
So my hw for me
Hw
Nima
Ogaloo
Imagine being Korean
Can't relate
Imagine being a small nation
So to support their cause is merely to support another cycle of a 5000 year old history
The commoners rise up against corruption, such is the nature of Chinese history
Continuing the great Chinese tradition of peasant rebellions
Hong Kong is rebelling against a govt they find unsatisfactory
Something an inferior being cannot comprehend
To support hk is to support China

Supporting hong kong is to support China
Ur minds don't need as quality oxygen to run on as ours
Our pollution has to go somewhere, y not to the inferior race
Only recycled Chinese air
Ur so inferior u can't even breathe ur own air
So u r doubly submitting to the superior race
While also admitting it has more attractiveness than Korea
So, by snacking on China, u submit to China
Therefore, u must submit to their will
To snack on one, u must earn their consent
Which is y ur birthrate is so low.
Ur so inferior u don't even like ur own country
And Korea is inferior
Which means China is more sexually attractive
But not Korea
See, u consider China as a snacc
Indeed
YANG GANG
Yang gang
Yang gang
You fool! You've fallen for one of the classic blunders!
We r so. Advanced every term is gender neutral
We Chinese r progressive
Gotem
Ur mom
I shall disengage now to help a man with his writing
A Korean wouldn't understand, for he has too little capacity to strategize and weigh
Indeed
To rid ourselves of this garbage
We must shower after this conversation
We must become uncooth to engage with barbarians
Can't u be satisfied with being clowned by me
Ben y must u insist on clowning urself
Since Korea just belongs to China
Because China permeates every layer of Korea
U will find a Chinese person
If u traced ur lineage far enough
Property of a greater empire than they could imagine
As the helots were to Sparta
Koreans r but slaves to China
The inferior must be made to work in order for the superior to succeed
Again, the Spartan needs the helot
@Will Liang
Ur just defective since u aren't
Such is Korean nature
Such is the nature of the world
They r both #1 because they r both Chinese
Since it is China
So Taiwan is still #1
Taiwan is just another Chinese govt
Don't forget how Koreans r just inferior Chinese
Created by China
This is but a figment of Chinese power
Therefore u bow down to China
So by saying anything, ur just supporting a Chinese agenda
Therefore this chat is just another part of China
Just like China
This chat starts with a C
He laughs at how inferior u r, so hard he cries
The Chinese r the source of good Chem
Koreans can because they r close to the Chinese
U r beneath him
He sneers at ur attempt to make war
He laughs at ur puny stature
The inferior laborers and the superior administrators r both essential
India needs both
And Korea is the helot
China is the Spartan king
So do we need our Koreans
The Spartans needed their helots
I mean superior countries need the labor of their interiors
I do not dissent
Because ur jusf too small brained
U can't even understand such a thing
By cloning himself
He reproduces asexually
See how inferior u r
Something an inferior man cannot fathom
Mitosis
U have only id, not ego nor superego
Ur mind only has enough storage to think of reproduction
U only think so because ur too inferior to think of anything outside of porn
A natural reaction to seeing such a perverted species
He was so revolted by the barbarian that he stopped playing in shock
I cannot understand the workings of such an inferior mind
Y must u insist on getting clowned by ur betters at every turn
Ben
Ye
Ur too inferior to know if the biggest anime platform
Makes sense
O wait ur Korean
Only inferior minds need porn
Y u on pornhub?
Imagine needing to download anime instead of using one of the largest anime platforms u urself created
Ofc western music can influence the west
Since kpop is just reskinned European music
I thought u meant by
O u mean heavy influence on
Every country has that
I mean yes but idk y u see that as a positive lmao
Which everyone had at some point
That isn't generic shamanism
Wait does Korea even have a surviving native religion
Intellectual property theft
India has a rich culture and history of not having to borrow its own high culture
Indeed
India best territory
As long u as bow down to China, u r welcome
U r equal with the Japanese, who own the Koreans
Indians r welcome as superiors over Koreans
Koreans did come over to the superior country a lot
Some weird person tried it, prolly of Korean descent
Because that isn't traditional food
While Koreans r too busy trying to fight for housing in Seoul
China has a sense of unity and mutual help
Y must u insist on being so thoroughly outmatched and clowned at every turn
Unlike the Korean language and culture
We don't need to copy other countries and use their stuff because we aren't garbage
China isn't gonna use Korean 5g because of Huawei
For we r not garbage, we r Chinese
He is beyond ur comprehension, as am I
Only a homosexual such as u would
It's called being smart, something u wouldn't know
If we want to exploit Korea, we gotta make sure they don't run away cuz they feel bad
He doesn't want to make the weaker man feel inferior
U also admit inferiority by submitting to China in language instead of being creative enough to survive with ur own creative language
So by acting like ur mightier than China, u merely reinforce ur own weak mindedness by supporting China
The pooh thing came from China in the first place, so ur just strengthening another faction in China by referring to it
We r ur overlords so it's only natural
Thanks for respecting us so much as to use our words for all ur high class language
U can merely copy the memes and ideas made by China
U can't describe libraries or even a giraffe without using Chinese
China owns ur language
U can't even describe ur own foods without Chinese
Tang is soup in Chinese
Did u know
Is that a candy?
No need to reinforce ur inferiority
U have only proven my point
Only natural and true
Therefore China owns Korea
Japan owns Korea, and China created Japan
Just like how Japan is made in China
So it's only natural for Korea to be encased in a Japanese product
Indeed, Japan does own Korea
Ur using a Japanese product I see
Like Hyundai and Samsung/lg
Just a worse Korean knockoff of a Japanese creation
Unrepresentative of her
So ur just touching garbage pixels
That's Korean
See the language of ur browser?
And u r touching garbage
Ur merely touching pixels
Only capable. Of stealing some garbage flag
But u can't cuz ur too garbage to touch a Roman emperor
Get her out of my room yourself, coward
Is mutual affinity
Garbage attracts garbage
Because u r garbage
U stole the garbage
Unlike my Roman emperor body pillow
Because it's a garbage pillow
The one I let u get away with
If only u weren't garbage
U can't do quality, not even theft
Nah u just got the body pillow
Stealing all them Gibbons jokes because u CAN
R u Neil parkhi in disguise?
Smh
And stealing a Gibbons joke
Y u trashing rap?
So garbage I can't even deign to spell it correctly with the hands of a superior race
Like kpo0
And only Korean things can be true garbage
Cuz that's the only Korean thing I own
By which ur referring to Samsung
Yeah u ask me u I have garbage
Koreans just can't make quality, you'd know
Ik I shouldn't have brought garbage into my room
Sorry for buying a Samsung product
I do have the poster for my favorite movie, which happens to be anime
Tho it's more of a miniature statue
I do have a figure of a Chinese emperor
Not yet I haven't
Unlike my immaculate, cable managed room
He got a Google home in there
His room be kinda messy
Ah yes
Who is?
Gibbons best girl uwu
Mine r all yellow
Cuz fb knows ur Indian
No I'm saying fb is very pioneering in its racial acceptance
Bruh that's not very politically correct
Lmao
Tf
Black dracula
What
I think there's a very high likelihood a pedo is gonna end up getting hired
Who thinks the person they hire is gonna be a pedo?
U know, that money could prolly be better spent elsewhere
Money for the pilot program has been allocated from the Sycamore tech fund. Depending on the vendor selected, the program would cost between an estimated $50,000 to $100,000 annually for district-wide 24/7 monitoring of all student Google accounts, including the human component to actually interact with the content
So the worst you'll find in my history is prolly body pillows
I use incognito mode
Nah
But that's not part of this discussion
I mean I am problematic
If I searched up body pillows
So would I be flagged as problematic
Reading the article
So the school would only see my Google drive and calendar activity
And my main acct is my browser acct
I'm signed into it but my main acct is the one that's used for everything
Since my other existing emails were already tied to other accounts
When I was making a new account and didn't wanna make a new email
I think I used it to sign up for a game or something once
Lmao
Like get the bot to just constantly browse dark web cp or some shit
To send the most disgusting and illegal stuff in
What if someone just made a bot
Lmao
I genuinely don't remember
When does lippers put up grades?
As I always am
Gotem
In ur anus
No burnt ham
Lmao
I sent that exact meme like a week ago
Isn't it natural to objectify property?
China #1
Yes I saw
Idk y
Graydon always gets there early
I literally just woke up
You're at school already?
Jesus
Prolly
I wonder if my wifi will be able to finish downloading my six shows by the time I wake up

Bruh no

Tie some weights onto ur dick
Yes aadithyaa

Ur brain is simply too peasant to understand
Is magic
Don't question
If u plant ur dick in the dirt and fertilize it it'll grow bigger
Do dick push-ups
Gotta catch them all
U got hella std's then eh
Wow
Aadithyaa is more of a bakugan
My legs literally like 8 times thicker than my arms
So is whatever
I don't really care how my arms look
Didn't keep up with it
I tried doing push-ups on my own as a little bit of exercise before
Walking time
Eat the dirt to cut out the middle man
Eat the grass to synchronize with nature
Ima force u to try and keep up with me
Ay I can show u up
Cuz I'd get bored or want to go do something else
And I doubt I can keep myself running for that long without anime or music
It's easier to run on a treadmill than on actual solid ground apparently
Just set myself at 7/8mph and watched anime for an hour
It's not hard to run on a treadmill while watching shows and stuff
I'm great
My swim speed is roughly 1m/s
The only way you'll get any Is if u could persuade ur parents to give u a sister or a cat
I like running on my treadmill cuz I can watch anime while doing it
I out ran will after running for 9 miles in the same morning
Will is hella slow lmao
Wait yeah
Aadithyaa got mad gains on his right finger muscles
What a great word to use there
Lmao
Scurries
No one wants it
U can keep that to urself
No I don't
Where do u think
It's a prostate exam will.
This gonna be the most interesting prostate exam ever
Aight bet, I'll get the cactus out
Literally
That's a euphemism for prostate
I hope my ssd has enough storage to take all those shows for nown
My wifi is not
My pc be vibing rn
I'm such a good coder
Yo I'm technically usaco bronze
I wanna mav against the whole class in apush
I want more apush debates
I pushed prem down
But I didn't carry prem
I also carry in apush
So
I hate coding
I just want an A in the class
I don't want to learn compsci
Yeah no
Law of equivalent exchange
I carry in dagen
Ay
The only thing I've really been motivated enough to learn is how much I dislike coding
I honestly should've just dropped the class at the beginning of the year
No I don't
Ima tune out right heren
Aight
Public static void?
No
That is disconcerting
Even I can see that's wrong
In my defense
I thought for the first two quizzes
Hey
Ye
I sleep more
Ssh
Ima give it a shot
Mmm
This meme was made by the 90.6 gang
Bruh imagine getting an A+ in cs
The 4 in oren stands for foreskin
Those r antonyms
Will Liang and winning a debate
Cuz I gotta download this anime overnight
I hope I can sleep while my pc runs
That fucking hdd cable better get here quick so I can move my shit onto there
As I download like 5 separate shows tonight
There goes my ssd space
This show looks so much nicer at 1080p
Desktop version is trash
I just cheesed it and got 20
Sat essay hella gay
My parents just trust me to deliver at school if they leave me alone
Lmao
My mom thought I did fine but my dad didn't
I told my parents I'd stop at 1540 or 1560
Gotta meet my own standards at least
Can't let myself go with a 1440
Which I should, since I got a 1440
I just take it as I should do better
I guess so?
Just cuz u should try to do something better doesn't mean ur bad at it lmao
Just means u should retake it
That doesn't mean it's trash lmao
They're like $10 a pop
Anyone can afford a book
Wait
Wealth can be part of it, but culture more so
There's an actual correlation with the books ur parents own and how successful u r academically
Such as how many books there r in the house
Tho studies show its the home environment that matters most, more so than wealth
Or I can just wing it and take it like a dumbass
Just summer camps won't get u anywhere tho
So ur not wrong
I mean sat scores do correlate with wealth because wealthier ppl r on average technically smarter due to better education
It's just some college kid babysitting u as u do problems
Lmao
Sat summer camps r useless
Wait bruh
O what is all this about
So much anime to download
You're approaching me?
Oh ho ho
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Aadithyaa Sridharbaskari to .
Ethanol was better nickname
Litotes
I'm not at all a retard
I'm sleeping as soon as I finish downloading this show
I proudly do not accept
This is a Bruh moment
Gay
How was that understatement
I lost my temper
I thought they'd killed you
What
It's chiasmus because u swap love and beautiful
Chiasmus
Love u quote
For the love u c quote
O
I just finished memorizing the words and definitions
I was gonna write my assignment but I got sidetracked by being too happy
Ima sleep soon too
Lmao
I think that's still cap
So that's not really an understatement
It just says it would suffice to replace fire right
Wait that doesn't make any sense lmao
Quizlet be capping
I don't see it
And antithesis at the start
I see anaphora at the start
Along with free educational programs
We even give it to our minorities
Exactly
Nah they're just on permanent vacation
Except for ones caused by bad sewage
India literally too beta for plagues
China #1
The rest of the world just too weak for Chinese plagues
Bow, barbarian
To the progenitor of thy country
China #1
It's litotes
Ye
It's just true
It's not a joke

Lmao
Yeah
When ur not contradicting the truth to support it
Litotes
China is not at all superior to every other nation on earth
Yeah like that
Litotes is more obvious
Wait not really
I got an F in my math hw today
So in either world u must negate
In order to affirm u must negate
Vote neg
Deny to affirm
Gotem

No just the rhetorical modes
Free points tho
This sounds retarded
Tf is rhetorical modes
Wait wat
We don't need rhetorical modes right
Ugh
Yup
Flat is Justice set the nickname for Ethan Kuo to Ethanol.
Ethanol
Ethanol is highly attractive
Yes
We should Lynch him for racism
Will is racist guys
This meme was buried so far down in my folder
Finally found it
Too scandalous
I can't touch ankles
Nice
I failed all of them

Yup

Will is trying to guess
Lmao
Bruh he's gotta be cuz he's gonna be alone for life
I don't need others but I'd rather have them
I like being around others
Mmm
Tho I have also proved to myself I need to tune down on salt and soy sauce a little in my cooking
So I'm fine on that front
I've already proved to myself that I'm self reliant
Gonna get a new plague started
Gonna be a good time
Prolly gonna ask a few close friends to come with
Ima take a trip to China after school is done
I just sat for a little while
But once I received confirmation
So I was gonna be hella productive
I received confirmation
Ye
There's only one answer
Mmm
Pl0x
Ap classroom
Prem help me with compsci tmr
Time to start studying now
Fucc
So
So amazing that I ended up not being productive cuz I was literally too happy to do work
Today's been such an amazing day
So good
I used that line in my essay
I'll just expire
I won't die
Such good satire
His whole euphemism Skit
But not really
Kinda 6 cuz I just used dagen to nap today
5 free periods
I don't miss school at all outside of debate
Bruh I don't do that shit lmao
Smegma
Sounds fun
Yall gonna clown aadithyaa?
Now it's just not sending the other to my printer
It sent one form
My phone be dumb
This stupid thing
It's just not printing
Aight bet
Ffs
What the fuck is going on with my printer
Don't question my methods
Ay I can get u A in apush if u gimme quiz let
Bruh what went wrong
Ay share quiz let
Amc*
Amx
For @Will Liang
How did u do
Lmao
Roughly 90-95% of the shows I've watched take place in high-school for that reason
I am a connoisseur of slice of life
I haven't touched the shounen genre outside of DragonBall and I've done nothing with isekai
I guess I've seen what can be considered slice of life classics
Like cowboy bebop and fma
I mean there r hella classics out there for other genres I haven't touched
But I've been burning through the slice of life genre
I haven't watched most if any of the classics
Eh
I can't even remember at this point
Or maybe it was 4
I think 3 for #2
So I have five shows tied for #1
My favorites lists r hella packed cuz i can't decide between shows that all do different things extremely well
...
One of my five favorite shows
Ye
Is too good
I think this is my fourth watch, which I haven't finished only cuz I don't want it to end again
I've also got this one show that I've been constantly rewatching every time I finish it
Kinda hyped
I've got 3 movies and two seasons of shows to look forwards to
This year gonna be a hella good year of anime for me
Too busy getting through my slice of life shows
4 of them r classics that I prolly won't ever get to
Lmao
I've got 40 shows on my watch list
And hella that I just have waiting to watch
There r hella shows I'm waiting for rn
Haven't finished fate yet and I'm waiting for more kyoani
I've been too busy watching shows
Nope
I need to choose my next show to start
Mmm
Cuz u don't have to focus on words and can catch small details and changes in expressions if it's one of those really well done shows
I do think dubs r more convenient sometimes
Mmhmm
It gotta be majestic
It was a weird experience today when I listened to my movie in Japanese, read in Chinese, while Brian was in a vc with me speaking English
Subs take a little to get used to imo
Lmao
It's like an opera
This is objectively better than subs
https://youtu.be/z0sL7nVZ3Fw
Actually wait
There r some notable exceptions where both r equally good, but I can't think of anything with a better dub
Tho a little is lost in subs, more is usually lost in dubs
But subs r generally better than dubs as a rule
Some really simple words have an absurd amount of strokes in traditional
Tho it was traditional, so I got bamboozled by some words
Lmao
But they had Chinese subs so I was good
And everyone was asking for English subs
The movie I watched today isn't supposed to be released yet but it got leaked in some hong kong or Taiwan site
I always go for subs
Was worth it
One time I changed this anime to French dub just so I could hear one of the Mc say oui oui
English dub just feels wrong for me
So just watch that instead
But these films r all objectively inferior to boss baby, according to the Oscar's
So even tho it didn't get me on as personal a level as koe no katachi I still rate them as equals
Liz aoi tori is prolly the most well made movie I've ever watched
Cuz they r the classics
Should get to the rest someday too
The only ghibli I've watched was princess mononoke
Lmao
That'd be uncultured
I don't watch 3d women
Mmhmm
I don't think anything will ever touch koe no katachi for me
Also known as the shape of voice/Liz and the bluebird
My favorites r koe no katachi/Liz  aoi tori
So my second favorites r your name / weathering with you
Tho my list isn't exactly arbitrary id say
Exactly
Ironically my two favorite films r also by the same woman
Killer bean is too good to dignify my favorites list
Nah
The other one is by same dude lmao
Tied for my second favorite film
Ye your name is great
I chose not to do any dagen work cuz the debate left that much of a sour taste for me
Ye
But ended up watching another movie
I was thinking about doing it tonight
Gonna write it in flex tmr
Aight bet
Where I lived and why?
What was the individual writing assignment again
Tmr is big Boi work day it seems
I forgot there was a rhetoric test
O fuck
Ye
It was, I memed it
Fuck me
Guess not
Would've thought our judges were competent
This debate was complete byllshit
I memed a little but still
Whatever
O well I gotta work now
I thought the last dagen debate was bad but
Good fucking lord
This was the shittiest debate I've ever partaken in
They didn't give any other statistic
It was like their biggest contention
Fuck me I guess
I might as well just not have spoken yesterday
I'm fucking pissed
They ignored my whole speech yesterday
I disagree with everything that happened today
What exactly is the individual writing assignment?
Is funn
We gotta remove them threats
Then go for each other
Beat Jocelyn and Kiran first
Our deal
@Will Liang
Will
Bruh it's so fun
Still making dinner
No questions
Cuz they Christian
Ethiopia is part of Europe
Lmao
Bruh
Cuz the father gonna abuse them in all sorts of ways
What about verbal and physical
That's sexuak abuse
Brian gave me a card to read lmao
Nah I got Nixon 11
So the abuse goes up exponentially
So those ppl will abuse their children and the ppl they known
Cuz abused ppl abuse others
So they will abuse everyone they know
Was that the children will get abused
Wait what I said
U can't believe
Ima cap so hard
Yes lmao
Not in order
4. Potential of children
3. Future of America
2. Abuse of children
1. Sex slavery
U can't beat child sex slave
Bruh I got like 4 different impacts
Wait Kiran pm real quick
Lots of ppl depend on this man
He's just like
Wait Robert didn't have much of an arg
Nah but Kiran and I will balance them out
I don't see anyone going after Robert
Except for Robert
Team *
All the mun kids and debate kids will be on same Tema
If I get my whole group to join Kiran
Wait that's literally brain drain
Then we can have hella stacked team
If I get knocked ima get my group to join Kiran
Two speeches
So maybe one round gets another 2 out and then one more gets win
Yeah so one has to win
I can get Ethan fs
Wait do 2 more get eliminated tmr
Ima try to grab Ethan and aadithyaa
They're gonna join the other 4
Ye
Debate is prereq
To become high iq enough
Join debate
Ur not high iq enough
Ay Kiran do u think I knocked aadithyaa out?
Ur welcome
Cuz I was gonna go for u initially
Wait I thought he kinda clapped u so I decided to clap him instead
O lmao
I don't even know who Jocelyn went for
But everyone else went for governed
I forget who u went for
Aadithyaa went for u and I went for him
Like y
Lmao
Everyone else went after him
The governed dude
Wait everyone in my class went after Franklin or whatever the old dude was
Bruh we all gonna rape premed
Bruh Kiran arguing ww3, I gotta
But if Jocelyn gets tossed ima go after Robert and will
I gotta go for Kiran first
I don't really want to
Idk who will go after them tho
So I'll end up being the only man
Ima neutralize all the threats
Even if I'm not a threat
Like ananya literally told me she wanted to go after me but didn't cuz I just threw out so much cap
Cuz I threw so much shit out there
No one rebutted me
I have so much to say
Hopefully tmr we get two speeches
But my impacts be so sped they don't need numbers
I don't cap link chain either
6th is where u hella cap
4th just beta without capping
Bruh yall didn't cap enough in 5th
Cuz I just called aadithyaa a liar basically
My rebuttal was fire
My opening speech rhetoric was ok
First speaker war
Me vs Kiran vs aadithyaa
This is first speaker war right here
@Abhishek Koul that's what Kiran did lmao
Unless if u count infinity
I didn't even use numbers
Cuz aadithyaa just ran off coronavirus
I didn't even realize it so I hadn't thought of a response quite yet
Brain was the one who realized the bacteria virus thing lmao
Yeet
And ella
Ez
Me, subha, Brian
My group be stacked
Lmao
Even harder than I clapped today
Ima clap tmr
Aight bet
The most cap I've ever heard
So higher chance of war
He said the ambassador gets depressed
Kiran was pre med lmao
That's Jocelyn
Clap Jocelyn tmr
Yeah
Kiran is pre med
They're different
No
Wat
I think opera singer and bacteria man r getting tossed
Jocelyn hella clutched the governed dude
Who was Charles
What did they say against Charles
Cuz we're just better
4 for us
Jaiden, asmi, simone
Lmao
I only remember 3
So fun
On prereq and impact and case and shit
Bruh Kiran aadithyaa and I used hella debate terms
I just stood up and asked is everyone ready
Which is y everyone laughed
Apparently u buttoned ur suit every time u stood up
My rebuttal was just clapping aadithyaa on coronavirus
Or my speech
My response was comedy
Discord?
Dagen
For this debate
Ay nick what's ur period like
Call at 9?
Rip
If u can tmr plz do tmr instead
I gotta cook dinner
Yeah hep0 me tmr
Wait I just got home lmao
Cuz the force of my clap will rip through space time
Ima still clap u first
Fucc u
I speak last
Wait fuck
Not if I clap u first
I got Brian and subha on the same team so I was saying that to them lmao
Ay that's what I said lmao
Meanwhile ww3
I merely added to 8t
This is just apush debates except everyone is capping
Cap to the max
By capping
This is how u win
I said the war veteran will sell his children into sex slavery for his gambling addiction
I played number games
I just threw out a ton of important shit
Lmao
Don't see the 0roblem with that
Alcohol and gambling to cope
Ptsd
Man is war veteran
I talked about child sex slavery lmao
But decided not to cuz I just tossed so much shit out there
Bruh a Anya told me she wanted to respond to me
Relying on the spedness of classmates lmao
So we don't need bacteriologists
Just say ppl don't die from bacteria anymore
Wait bacteriologist actually so easy to knock out
Lmao virus
V nice
I'm pretty sure I knocked him out
Bruh do u think I knocked aadithyaa out
So no one responded to it yet
But she brought up that state collapse thing only in rebuttal
Ye
I wish I didn't have to speak last tho
Aight bet
They're the two strongest ones so we gotta make sure to knock them out
Just go for Jocelyn
No worries
Ay will I got Kiran covered
China #1
China must win
This is Asian solidarity right here
Nah
Just tell Robert to get Jocelyn
U don't need to worry
Nah will I got Kiran
Ye
Lmao
Aight bet
If she did ima clap her
Did she say the dudes death will leave a power vacuum?
I heard something like state collapse
Wait what did Jocelyn say

We should work together to knock Kiran out tmr
@Will Liang
Ay

I thought u did that afterwards
U answer the questions?
Wait
And a no can become a yes with enough money
Everything comes at a price
U can make big bucks
Will should work as a furry artist when he grows up
And I can prove it
True
So human age need not apply
Yes but @Will Liang is a cat girl
Will is a sanctioned good tho
Which had hyperinflation that was worsened by inflation
Bolivars
That was $5 Venezuelan
O yeah I gotta bring his backpack clippers to school tmr
Will is around $5
Well the wall is worth more than will is
Ur worth as much as a wall to me aadithyaa <3
Thought it'd be unfair if my friends knew less about my state of affairs than my wall
Ur welcome

O shit I didn't make a pickup line yet
Wat
@Will Liang
But those r the characters that translate into hentai in kanji
So I told him to look at , which I said was closer to looking like a giraffe

I was talking to him about mystical Chinese beasts cuz Japan uses the name of one as their name for giraffe
Just tricked Brian into looking up hentai on his school account
Lmao

But...
And get to the psych outline
I should keep working on my apush outline now
Fucc
1 reading guide
So today I have 2 outlines
O shit there's something to read
Facebook got birthdays covered for me
Dates don't stick
I've only remembered the last two years
And the only thing I remember from 2016 is election
I really don't know anything that happened before 2016
I have no idea what happened in 2015
The mayans were right
We've never been happy since 2012
The last good year was 2012
Nah
Last year wasn't it either
That might be what I was thinking of
Dying fish and floods
O that's true
So I don't count it
That was a carryon from last year
But something else happened that was shit
I'm not sure whatb
I feel like you're missing something
They're all sold out in China, pretty much
. Might wanna get some face masks
Just an fyi
O yeah the coronavirus just hit CA

?
Gonna do it Monday night
Idk
Ur just too smol brain to see it, unlike me
Therefore China is stronger than Europe
The black plague didn't destroy China, but it fucked Europe
Nah it's just proof China #1
Don't see where ur getting Africa from
Iirc
The black plague originated in China
Nah it's China
Bag*
Also @Will Liang I have ur bad clippy things
They all felt hella retarded
I got a ton of Bloomberg ads over cable when I used it to watch playoffs
I have a few handfuls that u wouldn't get so they don't count as my reserves
And I'm not inclined to replenish them
My reserved have ran dry
U have been blessed
This
Tho I'd never have realized if I wasn't told
I've got one that's meant to be oreos
I have more
It is
Uncultured
You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.
Hey you
I just know it was a blessing
I don't remember how I found it
Finally woke up
I found some subreddit that just turned shit into anime characters so I downloaded a bunch
Dishwasher
Ur not cultured enough for the third one
The third one
Idk which
The second one is some ww2 battleship
The first one is earth
This is big brain time
M
Ryan ou?
Wat
As always
And write 5 essays
Something that has already taken place doesn't need more time to happen
We all being enlightened by Neil here
Lmao
Mass transit
O shit
Time to start the outline
Welp
Can't relate
Imagine having to do that assignment rn
Ha
So my brain hasn't received adequate stimulation
My excuse is that I haven't watched enough anime today
I thought something was off
Lmao I looked at the wrong date
O wait yeah
It's actually kinda odd to think that I was still in Arizona 5 days ago
Mmhmm
Didn't think I'd find it outside of China
The best part of today was finding my favorite brand of coconut milk at ranch 99
Bruh I'm not looking to contribute to climate change
What's the point
I can't even eat the card
Unlike my report card
These stickers hold much more value because they can be applied to my laptop
It's not like we didn't already know all our grades
5 days
Lemme see
Um
Bruh I've been waiting for these stickers for
Shame it has to end
This has been a good weekend/break
Not some stupid card
I went there looking for stickers
It's not what I wanted to see tho
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
Also I got my report card through mail sometime in the past few days
What a sacrifice
Time to read in some class tmr instead of watching anime
Welp
Fucc
God I have so much work to do tmr
Ye

My computer is the most important part yes
In reality I only need three little folders and some binder paper
Bought them thinking I'd need notebooks this year
I have a few notebooks around that I don't use
Nonono
No
Discuss
If a person is brain dead
Die
Such a good movie
V nice
Finally got around to watching my movie
Ez
Ima read in math tmr
Search deep within your heart
Yes
What unit r we om for psych rn
Gotem
Ur mum
To avoid the gay
So he's trying to redirect u
U want Graydon to give head cuz u gay

Cuz ur gay ass want head
ur not a real horse owner until u jack off ur horse
wat
ima do my apush outline in apush and math tmr
so i just gotta hurry up a little this time
i just remember taking it nice and slow
i just gotta catch up to whatever i was doing

fucc
tmr at flex ima get fucced proly
o shit
o well
we made a little intro
o aight
o whaddya do today
bruh
the one u did on friday
the separate peace one
gonna write that tmr then i guess
aight
conclusion or nah
for the dagen writing assignment
yo
The results aren't up but we're referring by brackets
They didn't even respond directly to most of our points
We kinda raped them so idk how we lost
Lmao
We're done here
Rip looks like we went 2 3
It kinda depends on the tournament
Nope
Tho I could he wrong about the 3rd one, Graydon thought it was close while I thought we crushed them
Ended up winning the next 3 in a row
Going 0-2 did put me against some not so good teams tho
I'm not particularly angry about it but it's annoying
So if I'd just known to bring that number up I would've won
Right after the round I found an imperical number that I actually found before
But then he said we didn't have imperial numbers so we lose
Like the judge laid into our opponents and said he believed our points more
Lmao
Tho first round we actually clapped but lost cuz there was this single number we didn't bring up
When I took a nap after second round I clapped third round cuz I was awake
Lost cuz I wasn't fully awake
That's what happened yesterday morning
Or get sleepy
Unless if I get matched with a beast team next round and get fucked
I think I have a good chance at breaking into elims
Next round starts at 12 I think
I'm at the tournament rn u goon
What do u think lmao
I'm in Arizona rn
...
Lmao
Fuck
I mean for psych
Otherwise I would've prepped for debate
Which means idc about A-
And that's all I care about
It does for UC's
I just didn't care about psych so I flunked the final and got A-
I got half A- and half A
I narrowly escaped a B in sos lmao
Yeah cuz u don't take the class u goon
Can't relate
Or being worried about the final
Imagine having an A- in apush
U clown
I think
Gotem
Like ur mum
Gotem
Ur mum
Indeed
A man of culture I see
Yes
Lmao
I do copy a good few journals
Ima say I got off flight in morning and went straight to tournament so forgot until night
Aight bet
Makes sense
Hmm
I will pull addothyaa
Send me ur outline
Hey prem
Actually
I wonder how much he takes off for late outlines
But I'm dying cuz of flights
I need to start doing the outline soon
Ay prem send pics of journals
Mmm
Imagine not being alpha enough to take apush
Imagine stressing about apush
Lmao

Gotem
With ur mum
Yes fuck him
Lmao
My math teacher just leaves me alone to watch anime
Imagine having a difficult math class
Lmao
Bruh lmao
Lmao
Bruh
Take out stat
No math cuz Stat is inflation
So remove math from weighted grade
And math doesn't count
Aight
Weighted tie breaker with apush grade
No
Tie breaker with apush grade
Everyone here takes ap's
Unweighted
Sem 1 unweighted
We should base status off apush grade
I just dont use immessage anymore
Lmao
Really makes the hentai pop out
With the beautiful colors and calibrated screen
Bruh that's what I bought my surface laptop for
And some retard bought it for 500 cuz it has an apple logo
Then I up and sold the thing for being a piece of shit
Lmao I used to use my Mac for immesage occasionally
Imagine using immessaging
Bruh lmao
What's going on
Wat
Lmao
She didn't post 5th period?
The grades
Someone send 5th period
Lmao
Everyone just thought it was cuz it turns out no one really knows how I write
It wasn't u sped
Lmao
It's been a while since I managed to write a topic sentence wholly unconnected to my thesis
I really did a goof on this essay
Me sitting here with my C+ essay lmao
Which was my original suspicion
Prolly just put a placeholder grade for dagen specifically cuz she didn't put anything there
Then my GPA would be 3.5 as well
Not q1
Otherwise my GPA would be like 3.5
Wait it's definitely not based off progress grades lmao
But you have one coming up this week fs
Idk
Tmr?
Then maybe you'll do it another day
Im talking about ur in class partner writing assignment
R u retarded
?

Not formal at least
Not essay tho
Partner
U have a writing assignment
Lipman finished presenting and watched something
Psych or apush
Just skipped math entirely
I'm already home lmao
U can leave at 11 if u want
Yo abhishek we're excused for the whole day
Fuck
aight so i thought
friday right
wait when is this due
lmao
so i vote no
idc
i remember
lmao
he left?
Yeah I'm watching a movie tonight
Holy fuck
So term GPA is the semester gpa
Wait
What's the difference between term GPA and cumulative gpa
I doubt anyone remembers
Lmao
This is y u join debate
Lmao
Ye
So I wouldn't know to take it early
She'll prolly spring it on us
Or she'll just grade my incomplete essay and give me F
So it is victory for me
And I won't be back until Monday
Cuz then I'll miss it
Hopefully it's Thursday
Will u be kinda sped
Lmao
Hahaha
What an idiot
Imagine not knowing the prompt for the essay
Lmao
Ufotable is great too tho
Kyoani is best
Also it turns out the movie lippers talked about in class wasn't on my lists but I've heard about it
Ye
And four of them r by the same studio
Lmao now I've got five shows tied for favorite
Gotem
Unlike ur mum
I use it after eating and stuff
Like soap?
God damn
This show I'm watching is so fucking good

But I have to do that again too
That was miserable
Except for the wisdom teeth removal part of it
10/10 would do again
This has at once been my most productive and least productive break period ever
Time to start reading
Cuz I'll be fucked and unable to do much anyways
Prolly gona start in the next two days
Soon
I need to start
Ducked *
I just told Brian I'll wait outside and fucked out
I'm at the theater right now
So did I
Hopefully Brian remembers to grab it for me and recycle it
Ah shit I left my pocky box on there
It was so fucking stupid
I just had to walk out
Bruh the ending battle
Yes
Ye
It was funny
I kinda did
I expected to enjoy the movie
Decided to just step outside and play my stupid gacha game for a little
God damn its so fucking stupid
Didn't finish it
I was waking rise of Skywalker
Bruh I'll just go to chernobyl so I can grow a third eye
So I just get three monitors
It's three kingdoms
Wait
O yus
So I can get orgasmic graphics instead of weird glass
I'm literally waiting until I get a better gpu to play that game
Not three kingdoms tho
Most games yeah
Modern art
Or tape it to a wall
Lmao
Bold of u to assume I have any kidneys left
Cuz 1440p 144hz doesn't require the best of the best anymore
Then I'll prolly get a used high end gpu
I'll wait for that to see what comes
Very cool
It's like this conference where they reveal stuff
Imagine being on 14nm
Ye
So it'll still be Nvidia vs amd
Lmao apparently the intle gpu is shit
Stonks
I bought their stocks a little while back
Ye
And then I can nab a used 2080 ti or something
But now I think ima wait for the next ces
That's what I was planning
30fps capped time
If I run at medium settings
1440p 60fps
Cuz I am a poor man
Cuz I don't use Chrome
U right
Which is now a superpower
That pc is as powerful as India
So I gotta get that visual experience
All my games r more cinematic
Ye
World of tanks
Gonna save up for a good while then get a beast gpu
Rx580
Stuff like Xcom2, wot, and destiny
Tho rn my gpu can't run most games at 144fps
Yeah
Wat
Or been more patient and waited for the 27 inch one to go back into stock back then
Should've done more research so I didn't have to do that
I bought the second one cuz I couldn't stand the color banding on the 32 inch one
Both r
1440p
Not gaming tho
I kinda regret the 32 inch one tho
Ye
One is 32 and one is 27
My parents would murder me if I asked them to buy it for me
Lmao
This is y u get a job
144hz
The new one I bought is 27 so it would be a little better
Lmao
32 inches
Like I'd be fine with 720p on my phone or maybe even laptop
Not when my monitor is the size it is
I'm not gonna watch 720p like a fucking barbarian
And so I pay for hd
Ye
So now I actually have a reason to use edge of all things
Which is y it looks like shit in my monitor
Is that chrome and Firefox cap Netflix at fucking 720p
Also one thing I discovered only today
@Kiran Suresh @Anaani Muss how do u feel about the ascension of ur dearest leader modi
Pm modi has ascended to God hood
It's a new world
How the times have changed
India is a superpower now
It has been a decade since I've seen yall
?
And that isn't me
In my defense
It's all about writing so I figured I actually have a pretty good shot
Not like I've got much better to do
But y not
I'm gonna apply and prolly get rejected
Drown in the hilarity
Indeed
Gotem
Ur mum
Hard shit
Tasp
I've even ascended to playing through a jrpg lmao
And that is watching anime
Ik exactly what I'm doing with myself
Hey
U fig
Check ur discord
@Will Liang
Hehe
Finished the final fast so I could watch anime
That was such a good time tho
Not like u needed to cheat lmao
Bruh
Lmao
Welp time to tack on another paragraph
O shit I didn't see that the prompt I wrote for talked about why I find it interesting
I prolly did but just forgot about it
Cuz I don't really remember screwing anyone over in the past three years
For which I'm kinda fucked
And what I'd do differently
One is telling them sometime when I upset or hurt a peer and regretted it
And then the next two things r both scenarios where they ask me what I'd do
The second one, which I wrote for first, was describe something u find interesting
The first prompt is what challenges or opportunities have u experienced in ur formal and informal education and how have they shaped u
Plot is a synonym for big tiddies
Lemme see the prompts realnquixk
So it only makes sense for me to talk more about books and anime
I'm shooting for the one about writing and story telling
Bruh lmao
It's gonna be a long one
Which I am doing for the prompt about academic challenges and opportunities
Wait I could've written some shit about anime lmao
I could've talked about anything I wanted
Or any topic I found interesting
The first one was just any interesting topic
Two of them r 750 max tho so they're shorter
Then some short answers
I have three more essays to write
Mmm
Two days ago I saw only sos was still up
Didn't all the grades get pulled
Lmao no
Planned to set up a pihole but never got to it
I've still got my raspberry pie sitting around lmao
What were u setting it up for
Lmao
That makes sense
Should've just made it one of the words u could copy paste
Kinda big brain tho lmao
Lmao
That is a Bruh moment
Bruh y lmao
Y did u do that to urself tho
...
Wat
Try to turn on tablet mode somewhere
Ugh
It's impossible on a pc unless if u somehow found the tablet mode to turn on or something g
U mean a laptop?
I'm tired
Writing essays is so draining
I think ima start reading on Friday
It's so good but some of the prologues
U ain't seen nothing until u read the wheel of time lmao
And I have a feeling ill be unable to do anything for a solid day afterwards
I'd completely forgotten that I've gotta get my stupid wisdom teeth removed on the second
It's more that I've realized my time might be a lot shorter than I'd anticipated
Rip
I haven't started yet
I mean it is only 200.pages

Can't forget +C if you've never learned it
U r allowed to enjoy it
Wait u aren't Asian so whatever
U gotta burn them at the stake for being possessed by Satan
Ur taste buds r fucked
God forgive me for my velcro genocide
I do not know how many velcro straps I've used
Done
Finally
Such is the way of royalty
Incest is wincest
He loved u cuz u were his brother
Kiss
No. Don't.
Incest is wincest
How will I arrange my mic I wonder
Time to get working on the cables.
Yes
So I wouldn't need to see it's ugly ass
I usually had it hidden cuz it sat on the side facing the wall
I don't like that
Fuck now my wifi thing is exposed
I hope I didn't break anything by pulling it so hard
I have mastered cable management once and I'll do it again
Holy hell why the fuck is the display port cable so hard to pull out
Looks like it's time for me to move my pc
Exactly
I see through the lies of the jedi
No
I will be depressed
No
This will be a good time
Time to recable manage everything
Ima have to move my pc tmr
Can't relate
Imagine sweating when hiking in the summer
This meme was made by the African salt trade gang
Imagine being so poor that u have to be concerned about wasting salt
Just use salt to preserve ur food instead of being retarded
If there was a hell for me it'd be cold
Imagine living up north
Lmao
I'm just skipping all the reading and either using common sense or the test bank to get all the answers of the quizzes
Lmao there's a testbank for the free drivers Ed thing on foothills website
Write a book
Swear on jah
If u don't stop fucking spamming ur school and personal acct r bout to get fucked
To such an extent that u won't want to open them for fear of the images I'll send
Or I will obliterate your inboxes
Stop spamming that fucking link
I swear to God
Will
Modi will suddenly ascend
Ah yes
Put some whiteout on urself and it will be considered
But brown man bad
I am sorry
Yeah ur too brown to help China
Just what India needs
But also help in population control
Cuz his designs r not only cost saving
Kiran is the next great Indian architect
He's wet
Too abstract
It was simply too powerful for the digital medium
The modern art was too much for my camera
I didn't take a Pic of urs
If u improve my F, it'll still be an F
Age is just an integer
If (age < 18) age = 18;
Heard that is very good movie
O damn parasite
Abhishek is a tender and innocent child
Kinda sus ngl
Nick told me his name was nick
Lippers put grades up BTW
Apparently 800 on world history is 95th percentile :/
Nice
How'd u do?
V nice
Cb already sent my subject test score
Indeed
I used the epic of fucking gilgamesh lmao
Do what u want
No limits
It's an argument essay
Dude
Cuz I made mine non mla to give myself two extra lines
Also she never said mla right
Read mine
Will
That seems fine
Cuz I love using hypotheticals based off historical evidence
Which is a rip
Dagen doesn't like hypothetical
Read my first bp
@Will Liang
Both got around 30
Like for metabolism and photosynthesis
I mean each chapter usually gets around that many questions on other tests
Not too many
29 I think
That might be the move
Tho I could just ask someone to borrow their pencil and borrow an eraser somewhere else
A pencil and an eraser
Alright I've got all the equipment I need for tmr
I could doodle a tank and write a stupid pun
Or just any doodle I guess
Then just draw a dick for one of the short answers
Actually do the hw so my finals grade won't matter
I should do that in math next sem
Disgusting
No balls
I'll be watching u to make sure
Fucking do it I dare u
Do it
Aight bet
If that optional test pushes my grade up 1 I'd need a 65
Tho the optional test should give my grade big boosts so I think I'm still safe
I wish I had the security as I did in psych
I'm not confident with being able to cop a C on that test
Fucc
I need around a 76 if it's 20
Anyone know how much the sos final is worth?
I think I did well on the genetics test so I'm pretty sure I'm safe
So I just needed to not fuck up on the final.
I'm at an 89.4
Marty does
Lipman doesn't round
Cuz this final can actually alter ur grafe
Lmao imagine being anxious about ur apush grade
Time to get this essay done
You have fallen for one of the classic blunders!
You fool
Hehe
@Will Liang check ur apush grades
Which I always do
Should only take thirty odd minutes if I don't get hung up on wording
I've already got everything together
It's an ez essay
I mean I'll still pop off
My S1 grade is
My s2 grade isn't in danger
2 I assume?
Edit *
Peer edur
I mean I'll do it if I don't sleep after I finish it
The most surefire way to kill urself is to nuke Russia
In the span of one day
U can ruin ur country
If u just nuked Russia once
Wait actually yeah
More like a year or two
I don't think you're smart enough to ruin it in a week
I mean it'd take a really smart man to do that
Which is why you'd never become a successful politician
Politics aren't about morals
No one would ever do that
It'd be like a pyrrhic victory
Even tho it'd also hurt China
They'll more likely ruin their own economy than anything else if they stopped trading with China
Tho I heard the govt passed some bill with sanctions and stuff
The US won't do anything no matter what
Then what, the US will send another mean letter?
It'd be great if I were wrong but they're not irreplaceable like they once were
Hong Kong is only going to receive ruin more likely than not
I mean he's correct
What are they gonna do, send an army that can't even fire until they're shot at?
I mean the UN will have some mean words for Xi but he doesn't give a shit
That's where Hitler went wrong
Genocide is politically fine if it stays in ur own borders
The international community doesn't really give much of a shit
Actually not sure what's taking the govt so long to roll in
The army's camped out near Hong Kong
They didn't know anyone there that ik of
No
Tiananmen?
The army's already gathered nearby
Which is tragic
They'll prolly all fucking die when the tanks start rolling in tho
They're carrying on a great Chinese tradition of rebelling against shitty governments
Hopefully
Yeah I'm just gonna give up on that
No
Its so funny that they decided to choose a flightless bird of all things
Lmao new Zealand airforce really be represented by a kiwi
Great administration there
Sealand
Hey hey hey
Climate change? Never heard of it
Lmao Australia pm
Hmm
Is there any leader who's not retarded rn except for Kim jong Un
Guess I'm wrong there
Rip lmao
O rly
Kim Jung Un is glorious
And Kim Jung Un
Merkel seems good
Except Merkel
Rn every leader kinda a clown
Xi is less of a clown than modi even tho he is a clown
And India is just too beta
Cuz he represents India
Cuz modi is just that beta
Guys
Hey hey hey
Indians biggest historical contribution is some weird Arabic terrorist squiggly lines
Britain is being retarded
Imagine having a country that's split into two
U guys been waiting so long to copy China
So beta
Imagine being part of a country that doesn't send its Muslims into camps yet
Because Chinese population growth is slowing
India is much more severe while China is sustainable
India gonna starve cuz overCAPcity of ppl
East Asia cannot relate
Imagine
Unlike India
But China ain't poor
Lmao
I remember around Chinese new years Korean Air quality sharply dropped cuz of the Chinese fireworks
And Korea gets polluted air wafted from China
Like how stupid does a country have to be to not commit genocide against its own populace
India literally has an overcapacity of ppl
Don't bet against him
I mean India is a better territory of China than Korea is
Woodrow Wilson will softly stroke ur dick and imperialize u
Yes like how Koreans needed to copy stuff from China cuz they were inferior
Not as good as league of nations
Yes like how Koreans copied Chinese print technology to develop it
Should've just headed for the source instead of using a lame middleman
Japanese r monkeys copying Koreans that copy Chinese
Just like uighurs
League of nations op evidence
League of nations and Japan and Hitler
Ez
With hitler
I am Chinese so that is factually incorrect
I am big brain history boi
U cannot out compete my evidence
Lmao
I used that too
Use epic of gilgamesh
Go high iq like me
Hey

Cuz he's also stupid
Which is y will struggled with them
Lmao the dialogue is stupid
So u can't type sponge
Actually I doubt it has  on iyn
U can have a good conversation with an elementary schooler about SpongeBob or something
Yeah cuz that's like 2nd grade chinese lmao
It doesn't have enough characters for everyday usage
Idk y anyone would make a keyboard like that
Or they can just invent new characters altogether lmao
True
Like Japan did
So to make it streamlined they'd have to invent a new language that uses Chinese characters
Those characters might have to have different meanings than their normal ones
Well they can just substitute certain characters for certain things
Within a new language
They'd have to learn a new language within a new language
Every programmer would die
Will would fucking die
And China doesn't use English
There's nothing outside of America other than China
America is the world buddy
As do we all
U clown
Not for argument
Ofc you'd quote
It's a dbq
In synthesis essay yeah
Ye
Should prolly only take half an hour actually
Just have to get myself to actually chain it into two paragraphs
I've got my analysis and evidence
I've got the intro down
That's why I've got everything I need
Ye
Outside of motivation
I've got everything I need to write that essay in the next 40 minutes
40k my ass lmao
Small dip
Big rip
He's here to stay I'm pretty sure
Gotta wait for senate
No he's still there
So trumps fine
This is from Washington post
But hes not removed from office. The Senate determines whether that will happen.
He doesn't leave office unless senate says so too
Not by much
Yeah senate has republican majority
Senate is republican iirc
If the senate votes to not impeach he's fine
It has to go through the senate
Wait yeah he's not gone
Does this have to go through the senate too
Wait
Ugh
So that means we're left with pence
Wait
Damn
Like he actually got successfully impeached
Wait so he's down?
Holy shit
He gone?
Holy shit
Lmao
Thank u
U have expanded the possibilities of their relationship exponentially bk
Jerry could crawl in his anus
Tom could use Jerry as a buttplug
So r u saying
Wait
Hey maybe Jerry is into that kind of stuff
We live in a society
That's cap
Who's on top.
Nah Tom and Jerry would
Not my fault
It's what u said man

How would that have worked
Mouse and cat sex
They be immortal
It never ended
Lmao
I just clicked it
Ye
V nice
So just normal me
Cuz they capping
Lmao
Cuz no one would want to play me
If it was democracy I would've straight up lost every round
I won in a monarchal setting
It's how u win in a democracy
Talk like a retard to capture the retards
Ye
He's got a strong cult
Trump voters wouldn't care lmao
Don't they get criminal charges if they're successfully impeached?
Fucc
So it's just a slab of fat
Wait my mom ate all the meat off this part of pork
He is thicc with power
That's about as much as I expect will happen
Trump is gonna type some dumb shit again today
My grade be free
I am free
But idc cuz uc doesn't care about minuses
Now I've got an A-
There goes my A lmao
Lmao I got a solid C
I inferred about 20 questions
It was an L
It was the hardest test I'd ever taken
I won't get a D no matter what lmao.
I was just saying I didn't know the colonial period as well
I didn't study for anything
Tho I mean
This is psych
I would've been fine if I'd just known to study the last unit tho
Something that requires less effort
I wish something could've prepared me for the psych final
Bruh lmao
And interpret it
U just look at a pic
Wait stim is so ez tho
The secret to a good apush grade is good anime
Just read the textbook or do quiz let or something
Imagine using a test bank
Lmao
What
Which is the part ik the least
There was more than I expected on early colonial history
Cuz those tripped me up on the first test
Lmao I remember at least three of the questions from the first test
Wait what tripped u guys up
Just doing quiz let stuff should be fine
Everything I guess
Indeed
I just went through it really quickly to watch anime
I'm not an accurate metric
Actually yeah don't listen to me when it comes to history
Ez
Ez
Just farmed 11.5 ec in math
Lmao
Well she prolly doesn't know enough to call u out on it
Juliet *
It'll be about Romeo and Julie
I can give u a richey essay
She's bound to love it
And u can turn that into dagen
Ima just send u one of my richey essays
Hmm
Tho I like what I've got going rn
Wait if I write that essay I can go beast mode off that
They give a measure of freedom to take away more freedom
It's a measure of freedom
While fucking them over at every other turn
Give them just enough to keep them satisfied
It's an actual genius tactic for dictators
U can still give consessions while being an oppressor
Wait
The dialogue or the essay?
Lmao.
Double is fine
It's ur story, not mine
No u
Figure it out
That's be the logical conclusion I'm pretty sure
So they're gonna have to be the focus
They can talk, but it's about mlk and gladwell
I don't remember the last time I didn't double space an English typed assignment since middle school
She didn't say for us, so just assume it is
I don't remember the specific place
Somewhere in the textbook 1300 something
Bruh
She told u to open to the page and look at the prompt in class lmao
This is a very big Bruh moment
He was trying to pick u up
He's sitting on a couch watching someone live stream a pond next to a wooden cabin
Lmao
I also have Thoreau already at gladwells
Hey I've got the opposite going
The whole assignment is pointless tho
Same difference
I mean it's like a book right
Just write a dialogue
I don't see any point to it really
Lmao
Managed a nice B despite my sleep deprivation
I just straight gave up on rhetoric and studied the other stuff
Fulton final was kind of chill tho
I just remember ap week as being worse cuz I had to write 4 essays in one day
Tho it  kind of was for me too
Yeah fuck u
U sped
During ap week
The essay actually shafted me so hard too
I got straight docked on ap week
Fucc u two
Tho final week was bad too
Ap week u dud
Very much scathed
I survived
Lmao Fulton ap week was not a good time
I wonder what she's gonna make us do on ap week
Not I
U r
Z score
There would be some very interesting stuff floating around
If Brian could screen shot the stuff I said in discord vc somehow
I wanna see all the things I've said
Send sus shit of me
I mean I have the one where u said u like toes
I have a whole folder for that
Does anyone want stupid shit of will?
What's going on
I found the six digit code if u want it
I am on the ropes bois
The answer was very ambiguous
I asked him if he would curve me from an 89
No like
Rip I'm gonna have to go back to studying bio later
I have never washed a sweet potato as thoroughly as I just now did
When you're in the German army while assaulting Russia in the winter
Today has been a not great day
My lunch consisted of some bread and a little chocolate
Damn assholes
Almost got me to download mcafee
I had to download Adobe flash for this one question
I have to actually think and do math for this unit
Also put the spacing effect into practice by taking an hours break to watch some anime before reviewing the chapter ID just learned using his online questions
Sleep helps memory, so I decided y not
Ye lmao
Even tho I got enough sleep last night
I just decided to take a nap while studying this morning
That shit is draining my mind
My excuse is that I've been doing bio for a little while today
Remembered wrong lmao
O three quotes
I just know I chose 4
There were a few choices

The prompt the told u
Oren has entered the fight
Taking another's shoe in class
What a dirty man u r
Bribing him with his own shoe
Is as good as a confession
That's a yes right there
Nay thee
Kiran can bear witness
No u did
Says the man who sold me his two firstborn children
That's my future profession man
There's a big market in the middle east for underaged children
It's just that their pets or little siblings might disappear
I won't go as far as fucking their mum
We weren't assigned that lmao
Write a second essay
I've figured out how to use the epic of gilgamesh as one of my pieces of evidence
I just had an epiphany
Iirc
Lack of central direction/arguments
No
Ima just start watching that Chinese show I've been waiting to watch tmr
Watching anime with Chinese subtitles is v nice
Gotem
Ur mum
U died from the succ
That's kinda funny
Lmao

I have met my goals and become a productive man
I will be able to finish this show tonight
I have succeeded
I was gonna be productive tonight
I approve
Absolute clown
Look at this white man
He's Asian
Exactly
Yet ur incapable of eating them
Very normal Chinese dishes
U can't eat intestines or feet of any kind
It does
It literally means nothing that u know about it lmao
Everyone and their dog knows about 
Cuz that skin is fucking great when it's with the little steamed buns
Yeah no shit
It's like literally the most well known dish
Bruh
Where I leave literally nothing left of a pigeon
I can do it with whole pigeons
Ribs too if I get lazy
I just eat the whole thing bone and all
That's what I do with neck
So I don't bother much
Takes too much time to eat tho
Good shit
Nah yall just too American to comprehend true cuisine
Just like vegetables
Meat is meant to be cooked
I ain't no jap
Raw meat is bad
Mmm
Tendons and intestines
If I can chew on that meat for a little while, it's good shit
Chewiness is where it's at
Nah bruh
I don't want my meat to be crunchy like that
I don't like the crunch
Das the shit
Pork intestines and pork hooves
Intestines are where it's at yo
So might as well just have normal chicken with good chicken skin
I always peel off the skin and just eat the chicken
Fried chicken skin is actually bad
Fried chicken is just worse than normal chicken
KFC not bad but not good
Otherwise I'd prefer just the meat with a slab of bread
I don't like burgers unless if they have bacon
Yes daddy
I was v disappointed when I had it first time
It's overhyped
But chick fil a isn't that amazing
But I respect that
I hate that
I can't fucking eat seafood
I'm allergic lmao
Then y tf it called bento
Japan literally all seafood
Cuz if it is I can't eat that shit
Is that Japanese
I'd prefer just a slab of bread
I don't like burgers much
It's average Tbh
It is a perversion of food
No
I stand by that statement
It is time to commit genocide against Koreans
U can accompany Kiran
Nah u bouta becomes abhishek's sex slave
Someone wants to become a comfort woman
But it turns out u liked panda express
I thought u were big brained
I am very disappointed in u
Ur a race traitor just like nick
Ethan ur dead to me
Dude I will declare fucking holy war on u
Isn't Korea just a Japanese prefecture
Ethan ain't even asian
Aight bet
For saying what he said
He's gonna get disappeared
Ethan won't show up at school tmr
Ethan is getting lynched
Lynch Ethan
Ethan is more chin
Who is a false Chinese
Unlike u
I am a weeb which makes me more Chinese
Otherwise you'd be able to eat Chinese food
Ur definitely more western than Chinese
Bruh that literally doesn't count lmao
U can't spend ur fucking infancy in a country and claim to be firmly rooted in that country's culture
That doesn't count lmao
3?
Up to like what
U went to elementary school here
U did not grow up in China lmao
Bruh a 2nd grader could get a 5 on that ap exam
Unlike u
I am Chinese
I grew up in China
Lmao
U aren't even fluent
U have no authority
I am more Chinese than some man who doesn't have the stomach to eat intestines
Japanese culture might be ineferior, but it's still a copy of Chinese culture
Because they consume more Chinese culture
A weeb is superior
And now I will go back to watching anime
I will see u in court tmr
And this is now theft of intellectual property
I said it first so I'm more legitimate
Any answer u give will be false
And u r false
I need not answer to a false man
I have answered the truth
160000hp
U have been thoroughly discredited
And definitely not the truth
Ur sped
False
Means I don't have to answer until u answer
How many horsepowers does a Spanish corvette have
I asked first
False
How many horsepowers does a Spanish corvette have
Cuz u got no pk
Ur just gay
No ur not
My name is truth
Yes
There's no evidence for ur claims either then
Just cuz u don't like the truth doesn't mean u should doubt it
So they didn't pose the question but merely echoed me
They started asking too
And when u seemed like u didn't know
I asked first
I represent me
Lmao
The only times I ask u if u know someone is if it's historical
Lmao
I don't
Ur small brained
U failed at logic
Since u failed to use basic logic to contextualize my question
Otherwise I wouldn't have asked u who she was
U would've been able to tell she was a historical figure of some sort
If u used logic
Bruh
Not my fault lmao
Hey none of u sped asses could argue against my stupid logic
Literally no common sense
Guessing that Helen Keller is orens sister
Says u
My storage of useless facts is immense
Logic and facts
Thinking in words
So my left brain is still bigger than urs cuz of my thicc historical analysis
Analytical thought is there too
I do want more unique evidence than Hitler tho
Tho I'm trying to see if I can fit the epic of gilgamesh into my essay somehow
Already came up with basic framework and evidences and whatnot while she was talking lmao
Don't need to do much
I'll work on it tmr instead
I was gonna start but I'm tired from work
Get rekt
Thou art a poopyhead
God damn
This is long too
Ugh fucc
That's how u become a helpful man
See that will
Aight thx
I don't see
Tell me page number
Bruh
Dumbass
I'm asking u what it is
What's the hw tonight
Idk
Pokmon stuff
O what's the hw tonight
Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokmon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokmon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armour, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokmon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defence stat + high HP pool + Acid Armour means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.
U rite
I mean it's not a uc but ok
I'll come to ur funeral if u offer free food
Nice
For now
You have kept ur penis privileges
Well said
I cannot argue against that
I will help u proliferate
Issok, I gotchu
There's no such thing as too sus
Prem will become ur sex slave
No worries
Nah I'll sell u
And u draw rule 34 Thomas the tank engine
Ill sell u prem
How about this
How about Venezuelan dollars
Fucc
10k yen? Bet
Will how much would I have to pay u to draw rule 34 Thomas the tank engine
This is a revelation
I just realized that
That exists
Thomas the tank engine rule 34
My expectations were at once subverted and exceeded
Is he gonna send tunak tunak tun
https://open.spotify.com/track/1YfDfk1s3U1iexGila4UC2?si=Qfe4Iud3STi_czrRLwc2NQ
Damn this song is fire too
Not jfk, teddy Roosevelt
I just know I'm proud of it
I still don't know how I came to that conclusion
Stuff on the equivalent of when I asked dagen whether she thought mucus was a natural lubricant
It was the stuff I said during lunch hours really
I mean I never went too too Har during class
Lmao
Richey only got a preview
Fulton has heard a ton of weird shit from me
Fulton and dagen would both just shake their heads in mirth if they saw the shit I said online
Damn I think I just got the upper hand here
Yall r the ones in danger
Not gonna surprise her
This is what she'd expect out of me really
She prolly won't see anything out of the ordinary
I wonder if dagen knows what sounding is
Ur a disappointment will
Fucc
That means u won't just start drawing hentai if I nuke u
Darn
It's a yes or no question
Hey @Will Liang do u have a predisposition towards drawing hentai and/or furry porn
If I'm not careful ima become an audiophile and lose my life's savings buying shit
Watching anime and listening to music is such a great experience with this setup
Imagine if I just carried my pc and all my peripherals to school
Even tho my earbuds r nice, they feel dinky compared to my home setup
God I wish I could just bring my audio setup to school instead of using my earbuds
Ah fuck this song is fire
Good times
I remember when I taught everyone what sounding and docking were
Sounding ain't gay
Depends on whether or not it goes up the urethra
So will would have to have a predisposition towards drawing hentai even before getting nuked
So nuclear radiation only speeds up the process of proliferation
Technically the first hentai was created in the 1700s
Now they enjoy weird tentacle rape instead of mutilating Korean women
Our lord and savior
Truman nuked Japan because he knew it'd result in cat girls being created
There's a large female market too
And whack shit
Both a normal tradition
So it's like
On the other hand, plenty of ppl fuck pillows regardless
On the one hand, ur fucking a drawing
Pillows r in a gray area tho
But jacking it to drawings just ain't it
Enjoying quality shows ppl drew isn't
Jacking it to stuff some guy drew for money is weird
Does ppl who don't exist include dead bodies
Like gimp
I'll just stick to normal porn thank u very much
No like
The proportions r scary
Hentai is actually some whack shit tho
The younger the better
Abhishek would know
Those ppl pay a lot for weird porn
Will should draw furry porn for a living
Get bullied
@Robert Gan ur a poopy head too
Mmm
This cantaloupe
Haha gotem
@Will Liang ur a poopy head
Ima severely bully him real quick
Hey watch this
Ez
I bully will
I can sum up. Our relationship in three words
So the score is actually irrelevant
I was gonna clown him even if he got a perfect score
Not a perfect score
He got 1510
I gotta hit a better sat writing score next time
I do need to ask him how he practices writing tho
Lmao
I'll still clown him for studying
Now to find out how will did so I can clown him for studying
V nice
I should be safe tho right
So cutoff is 223?
So 223 could be the cutoff this year right
I went sped mode last year so this was a big jump
Getting something wrong in that math section is kinda sped lmao
But still
Prolly - 1 740
Ik
Lmao
Lost 20npoints there somehow
I went kinda sped on math
Ye
I'll make it if it's the same as last as well
223 right
What's the cutoff
I might be just one point above the cutoff lmao
Especially since I took both in the same week
Which is just stupid
Cuz now my raw score in the psat is higher than my sat score
This is kind of depressing tho
Good score tho
Kind of disappointed in myself for this
That's just kinda sad
Can't believe I got something wrong on that math section
Math I got 740
I wanted that perfect English man
Ugh
750 reading
I screwed something up rip
How'd u do?
Tho I did just 2ake up
Lmao I forgot about them
What for?
This is a positive good
No ur just sped and need Chinese conquerers to take care of u
Ur actually sped lmao
...
The first box is early score
Just read the first box lmao
That's cb
U sped
9th is tmr lmao
It accesses some server in NY to get all the scores apparently
Ima just see if it's up early morning tmr
Cb would be 10th
Not cb
Earlyscores
They just say it'll be there at Dec 9 for everyone
Might just be up early morning for all ik
Not sure when
O u right
It's time to cop that 400
Public safety announcement
Dont forget to check early scores tmr for psat
Sleep time
This is too much
Get out brained
Boom
F = F
Instead of drawing furry porn for a living
Imagine doing cs
Idk y but I've been just dying today for no reason
Lol
I can understand these older articles pretty easily, but I was kind of just dying so it took a while.
D as in delta right
g = 9.8
U just have to go big brain in class for the most part
Dagen isn't actually hard in terms of workload outside of class tho
Pagtakhan is still hard so they still have a hard English class
Shouldn't change for them.
Aside from dagen, I have two classes where I have to put a little effort and time into and that's it
At least for the classes I'm taking.
U just need to put a little time into it
Nothing else is truly hard
The only hard class they'd have is dagen tho
Everyone telling me junior year is harder than sophomore year was capping
Literally coasting this year compared to last
Got me a tasty 100 on the cellular respiration test
I just read the chapters the week before the test
There's like 30 minutes of math hw every day but I don't do any of it
I'm legit coasting this year outside of dagen
Didn't cost me any hw or grades
9-10 hours in two days
Literal two season show
Watched 24 episodes of anime over two school days
Lmao I popped off this week
Imagine taking classes and doing shit outside of school
O
Wot?
Iceskate?
Huabin?
O for some competition thing
Brian will prolly get in so it's more like the rest of the ppl applying fighting each other
Those two classes think I'm big brained
Well with the exception of math and apush
Lmao
Not as much as they do
Than the kids from Dennis Fulton and dagen
Lmao all the sophomores and ppl in my non dagen classes see me so differently
They haven't suffered
Most of the sophomores r literally sped so I guess it balances out
You'd have to be literally sped to not have an A+ in that class
So
Their class average on Mc tests seems to be around an 83 or something
Nop
A lot of them don't take me seriously cuz they saw all the shit I pulled in normal bio last year lmao
Which is a Bruh moment
I can't flex on the sophomores rn cuz their class is literally sped and they all have good grades
They don't have dennis
I'm gonna nail the first and last outline above my bed when I get them back
I haven't had a genuinely bad teacher here yet so rip
I never minded Dennis so idc
Cuz I can actually read the textbook without feeling bored
Psych is the only subject at school that I'd genuinely be interested by regardless of the teacher
No
History too I suppose
English is really only cuz of the teachers
Everything else at school is boring
History English and psych r actually interesting
At least compared to fucking math
Psychology is genuinely interesting
I might just take that
Wait is developmental psych one or two periods
I might just take human geo
What would the human geo teacher do
I want to find a sufficiently chill class for that
I might not have any classes to watch anime in next year
What a disappointment
Damn
Like would the teacher penalize me for watching anime in class
Is Stat a chill class
Maybe I'll take normal Chem over the summer and try ap chem
Ur right
Stat, bc, lit, ta, gov whatever
I forgot the last
I've got 5 pinned down
What classes was I gonna take next year
Wait
Imagine driving out for a class
I'd be down for ap Asian history or ap euro
I wish there was another history class next year tho
Everything else is gonna be ez clap
Next year I'll only have bc and lit to contend with
What else am I gonna do next year
Might as well
Ima take it
And I'll fucking do it again
I almost flunked math and got a B second sem cuz I just didn't do hw
I could get an A in Fulton and Dennis but I couldn't do it in normal physics and pe lmao
Actually tho lmao
Can't relate
Imagine getting B's in ap classes
Getting rejected from art school literally turns ppl into Hitler
Like u see how 100% of genocidal Austrian dudes named Hitler got rejected from art school?
Correlation is causation
So there is possibility of me sitting on couch for two periods in a row
She said yes
I asked her at one of the meetings if I could ta
I am
I'm gonna take that class and sit on the couch every single day
A return to our originsn
Social jpeg warrior
Very good time
Fulton kind of just let me say whatever I want
Fulton soc sem was a good time
Lmao when I try to wake up early to read I die
Read two
Ye
I understood most things so I took two
It took him around 1
It just often takes a reread or two in some places
It's not that I'm reading this deeply
If u can fully concentrate but don't try to understand everything
1 is minimum
Ye
I usually read my stuff during compsci and math
It'd take around 3 periods
U won't finish it
Prolly hasn't done it yet
It's a shitty essay
No college really gives a shit about the sat essay I'd think
I thought it'd take me 40 minutes but rip
More around 1 30 - 2
If u want to understand everything
That's if I went fast
Literal godlike
Bruh when I watch movies and shows on this 32 inch monitor
Feels godly
Try 1440p 144hz
Spooky
Arjun got the exact same score as me
Oliver bombed it and dagen was flaming him for it lmao
Ye
Thou art a good man, bk
I forget
Or was it 10
It's basically 8 trial pages
Prolly could've done it in one hour or so
When I started listening to music it sped me up
Partly because I was reading very slowly
It took me a solid two hours
Just send me all of them
I did the first one
Ye
Ye
The ws
This was an L
I didn't even play any games this weekend
So did napping for that matter
I was gonna do the thing but that article took me a lot longer than I'd anticipated
Ye
Better safe than sorry
Some sophomore thought so
Idk
Did he say it's due tmr
I would like to kindly request some pics of the ws if it's due tmr
Is anyone here in ap bio rn
I'm a sine function
I'm not
Sounds more erotic
Nah use erotosis
Instead of rhetorical question
Erotosis
I could be as well
Idk
Right?
I think u can't send the essay separately
I wanna see if I could get like a 8 7 7 or something
U don't need to take the essay for some
Some colleges don't require it
Uc required so rip
Literally didn't want to put any effort into the essay
7 6 7
I was tired and just vomited nonsense about anecdotes/connotation
Essay is always mad ez lmao
Would be much appreciated
Like - 1 800 for writing
I want a nice writing curve
Literal cap
It just literally didn't allow me to singup at any location
They should sacrifice December curve to make the other months better
The actual goons
Cb didn't allow me to take December for some reason
My math score was just depressing
My English score kinda pissed me off but it was whatever
Really got the same score as my monitor resolution
1440
My score or the month?
Sat essay literal sped tho
I didn't wanna retake but rip
Looked at a graph, got it wrong cuz I didn't read the increments
I got screwed so hard by my sleep deprivation on sat math
Thx cb
And their answer for the other just wasn't correct
I got two wrong on sat reading cuz college board thought I omitted one
But not as sped as I am when I do sat math
Always screws me a little
The sat writing is kinda sped
Feels bad when ur 6 years behind everyone else in English
I never managed to get a single B on a richey grammar test
The first grammar test took my grade down by somewhere around 6-8 percent
My grade went poof
Those Fulton grammar tests
First sem was not it tho
I made it to 89.7 and knew the ec was gonna push my over so I just stopped doing stuff
Lmao
And I got fucked so hard
Which was Latin American populist
Wait for the leq I got the single topic I didn't know shit about
And I got the same grade I got first sem
Literal Godsend
Then that ec dropped on me
I pulled it up hella but I wasn't gonna get an A
My grade was stagnant after getting screwed on three tests in a row
Lmao
Just not it
As a class
Dennis was just not it
I have had this argument with u before
After getting screwed out of around the same amount for the poster test
We deserved that
Hey
So I have two tests two study for and that's it
And bio prolly
Ye
I think the only class where I need to study for is cs
Idk what I have to study for for finals
Wait
I've got no motivation now
My grade ain't changing
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna wing the thing regardless
I could prolly get a B+ on that final even if I pulled the same schedule I did last year during finals week
Cuz I'm sped
Ima see the right answer and fill it in on accident
Cuz there's a high likelihood
But no I'm not gonna take that risk
Lmao
Ik what shooting for the moon is
0 is physically impossible
Bruh
Nothings changing
Unless if I ace the final or something
Nothing will drag me down unless I go full retard
I'm not gonna move up enough from anything
For my grade to move
There is any way
I don't think
Um
Which is exactly what my grade came out as
Like 5 points
That makes sense
V nice curve
101.3%
My Mc test grade
Lmao
Wait...
Looks like this is it for me
My grade dropped
Fuck
Um
41 after curve
His original was prolly 39
The generosity of that man
Nice
It is a nice experience
I enjoy being carried in compsci
They've somewhat degraded my opinion of ur quality
U know how many times you've had me help u with English assignments right
Then I'd be comfortable with them just doing everything
I wanna have a group project with Robert and Ethan or something like that
In compsci prem carries me every day
In math I've just abandoned my group
Except for compsci and math
Ye
I have a tendency to take over group projects tho
Ye
I don't wanna carry every time man
That way I can finally slack off for once in dagen
I wish we had a 4 man essay
Or 4
If it were a class essay u might as well just have an 8 person essay
4 man essay would be crazy
With a prompt
Prolly discussion
There's a lot of other stuff in there like how ppl view others and whatnot
And one must take active measure to oppose it even if it disturbs order
Immorality is upheld by laziness and submission to the status quo
It's more like
There's more to it than that
I did have to read some lines twice
Rip
Really?
U can see 1024 is smaller
If u compare the words on 1023 and 1024
The words in this article suddenly got smaller past page 4
What the
I enjoyed watching Alex get creampied
Each of these pages are roughly equivalent to a trial page I guess
It's one of those ones where she prints it so each side is two pages of some book or something
Technically
I just got to the third page
8
Just had to read three or four sentences twice on the first two pages
It's not very hard to understand at least
This is a long read
Rip
If it's not that long I'll read it tmr
How long is the article
Just read
No annotations
Rip
Instead of fucking up on math like a retard
Imagine getting raped by reading
Mmm
More like 600
Wait no
For a normal full page I put 1000 words on one side
4 sat pages would be around 2000 I'd guess
True
Prolly 3000 actually
It'd be over 2000 words if I'd cover 4 pages
Because I physically cannot do that
Do u just write really big
Bruh
Ez 20
Just vomit a pile of nothing on the page
Lmao
Essay tho
I did a big goof
U should've seen what I did on mine
Lmao
There were some really goofy answers there
I liked the ancient history questions
Lmao
Or the cold war for that matter
Or the world wars
There wasn't anything on medieval Europe
I just realized
Wait
Didn't see that anywhere on the test
Not jainism
Which I can't recall
I'm talking about the last option
Ik
Cuz that's reincarnation
Which ik for sure was wrong
I'm pretty sure it was an Indian religion
And thought Christianity didn't
I figured Judaism didn't
Seems like it
Did zoroastrianism talk about resurrecting the good
Dharmic religions r Indian, at least I was able to learn that during the test
Which was bad news for me
There were like 5 religion questions
OK so I got that one right
Vedan scripture was first written in sanskrit right?
I'm prolly gonna end up getting 4 wrong or something
And the other one was off by a few hundred
Out of the first answers, only two were in the same millennia
Mughal empire
Second answer
Mongol invasion
First answer
This one question was talking about 400ce
Lmao one of the options for what the bantu migration spread was monotheism
Even had the bantu migrations
Everything
Mine was like
Judging by the comments u guys made
Which is weird
This test went over a lot of shit
I didn't omit cuz I was mostly sure for most of them
Figured sanskrit was older
I saw vedan scripture and it asked me which language it was first written in
How old is hindi as a written language?
There were about 3 questions that I wasn't too sure of
I figured the test was useless to me by all means, so I elected to stay up until around 1 40 binge watching fate instead of sleeping
World history subject test was kind of a clap
Starve them until everyone smart either dies or runs away
How to cripple a country 101
They preferred starving
That is false
Irish genocide is their specialty
The English government has issued a cease to exist order to u
I feast on thighs
Help
I'm hungry
Imagine doing ur math hw
Triumphs over all
Epic Bible College
Neither
Good joke
That'll save me the time I'd waste writing those essays
I'm pretty sure I can convince my parents to not make me send an app to Stanford
Lmao
Today is a good day
I am content with my grade
Lmao
The subject u write about is also very important so
Gg
Authentic beings contain pk
Thou art inauthentic
To suffer
Gg
?
Cuz it's cap
I ain't doing hw tonight
Well I'll read it tmr then
She never told us to
I'm just not gonna read itb
Gg
Which is somewhere around 2/5 of the classes
And so far she's got 35 essays done
I remember that
Ye
I don't remember that
She said it replaced it?
Wait what
Wot
Squeeze
And not having miniscule handwriting
Imagine not having enough room to annotate
Can't remember what he said
Said no*
And someone said know
I said that once before about argumentative being the same as our Fulton essays
Wait
No she said it was argumentative right
If ur not in 6th period, u should know we have an essay later this week, but not tmr
We have essay this week
Yall focus on me fucking around and not doing my work, but aadithyaa low key worse sometime lmao
Lmao
He wrote about vaping
One and a half pages right there
So I wrote the entire list down
And it included this list of conditions and stuff for being a good wife or something
But the culture part was on the kama sutra
And only the culture part
I had like 3 pages left
This one time
I have the capability to do that, I did it last year
And blow it up into two pages
I can just take one paragraph of the textbook
If I had to
I mean
I take it to mean the outline if it's a smaller number
I usually specify
That's what aadithyaa does
Even I don't let it get that bad lmao
Also y do u seem to keep forgetting I took physics last year
So no possibility of that happening
I only had the chrome book last year in Gibbons
But I don't do that because I can just watch anime during class
5 more goes and ur done with this part
Like
I mean I do that when I run
Sometimes it's just some question I had
Most of the time it's some weird thought or idea popping up out of nowhere
Now I just talk to myself randomly in my head
Then I just stopped stopping myself
Until I read this one article about how some smarter ppl talk to themselves back in 7th grade
I thought it was weird cuz ppl told me it was
Since I was typing out my thoughts to myself, just typed that out too
I've actually thought that thought to myself quite a few times lmao
Could prolly hold a conversation with a brick wall
Sometimes I feel like I talk to myself more than anyone else
Tho I was a lot more emotionally fragile
Better self control
More motivation
I had way better time management
My younger self was so different
I don't know how I found it in myself to be so motivated back then
Makes sense with their backgrounds
My grandparents were very lenient compared to every other parent lmao
Back in elementary school I was the only kid who wasn't in some type of prep class outside of school
Tho I've always had a problem with motivation compared to my peers
Just straight dipped on my in 6th grade
Don't know where the hell that fucker went
I miss my elementary school motivation
And with the way high-school is set up this year, none exists except for dagen and to a much lesser degree, cs/bio
I can't motivate myself when there isn't a proper challenge
That's my downfall
Cuz I can't bother to learn all of this on my own
But I don't know everything yet, so I wouldn't be able to skip ahead
I'm learning stuff, just takes no effort to learn
So
I can literally learn it all on the night before the test
It's just that instead of learning it over a two to three week unit
Well I'm learning new things in math now
That was it
Learned a single thing in algebra 1
But instead I just stagnated for three years
Cuz op China maths
I would've been fine to handle geometry at that point, or at least algebra
Significant setback
Cuz I didn't learn anything for two years in middle school
Big mistake
I didn't know it was important in 7th grade
Ye
No
So
I'd have to take honors precalc next year if I didn't go with course 1/2
So I can take Calc next year instead of getting stuck in precalc
Cuz accelerated course
Normal precalc is an actual joke
If I did the extra credit points available in that class I'd have over 100% in testing
Not much he can do
He sees me not doing any of my work but still getting 58/60 or so on every test
He's given up on me I'm pretty sure
Or maybe I can read three kingdoms to relearn some Chinese
Maybe I should just bring my kindle and read some books about writing
Well if it's related to coding and scripts in any way, it's a no go
Never doing that again
I learned my lesson about taking my math notebook out in math today
Not anything coding
The last thing I want to do in math is math
Hmm
What's out there that I want to learn
That'd be productive
I should put my time in math to use learning something new
Time to watch good characters get gored to death
Went with the depressing one
Choice was between a kind of stupid but very fun show and a depressing one
Cuz it's not a good adaptation
Cuz I decided to drop the show I was gonna watch
Lmao I spent 20 minutes of math today deciding which series to start next
I watched some good shit this break
My break was watching anime and playing xcom
Must be a sad existence
Can't imagine having no pk
Will is sad too so makes sense for him
I'd rather read or write
Lmao
The last thing I'd want to do is code stuff in my free time tho
I'm decidedly neutral on cs
Cs is not annoying, but not that interesting
That's the other path he wants me to take
Rip
Guess I'll have to learn something next year instead of just cruising like this year then
So might as well
He wants me to minor in stats in college
I'll still take the class cuz my dad wants me to
Just not interested
It's not even hard
And I don't want to bother learning it
Like I could've learned it, but I'd have gotten an A on the final without it, so I didn't
Cuz that's the one part of math I just didn't bother to learn
As long as it doesn't have probability I'm fine
But still lmao
Ab will literally be worthless if I'm taking bc
But I want to meme it like that lmao
I won't
I just finished running and my head feels pretty light
Yes
Will can relate
I've half a mind to do it
And also normal chem
Cuz y not
I have half a mind to meme next year and take Stat with both bc and ab
I'm either interested or I'm not, too lazy to feign if I'm not
No participation points so I'm safe either way
Cuz I don't have the motivation to pretend
Yes
I can't say the same for math and bio tho
I'll just watch when I feel like it
So I'll prolly listen more
But the class is genuinely interesting
I kind of did it cuz it was novel at the beginning
I'm starting to 2atch anime less in that class tho
She laughed when I said my Pakistan shit lmao
She seems to like me
So I ain't getting another rec letter
And I'd get one from Fulton regardless
It only makes sense
I mean I'm applying for psych so I'm most likely gonna get a psych letter of rec
Uiuc says no letters of rec allowed lmao
Some of them say just one
It just says one, two if u want
No
So y would I take a stem rec
But most of what I'm looking at ask for a single one
Some of them two
They literally ask for a single letter of rec
Respond
U fucking idiot
Will
What do I need it for
Will y do I need stem rec
Answer me u retard
Y do I need stem rec
Will
But y do I need stem rec
I don't see any of my colleges asking for it
Y do I need stem rec tho
Ye
Wait y do I need a stem rec
Counts right
Psych
Wait y do I need a stem rec in the first place
Ima ask rozelle for rec prolly
Bruh
She's heard the shit I say during lunch lmao
Wait yeah sending it to Fulton won't do jack
Time to erase my account and claim it wasn't me
Pakistanis are similarly uncivilized
Gotem
Therefore uncivilized
Indians r brown
We don't do that in civilized nations
That's Egypt, Europe, and America
Can't remember how now
It's some weird link though my grandma
Didn't stop my family from getting fucked
I have a familial connection to him too lmao
Lmao
So I guess we'd be half  half
I share his patriotic views, but now his support of the ccp
Lmao
Bad idea but 9k
Ccp *
By western forces to slander the cc0
Figures since history is so ez
I got dubs on everything else tho
That's enough
I passed
I could physically handle it, but not mentally
I'm never going 5 days of 3 hour sleep again
Cuz I couldn't think straight due to the overwhelming sleep deprivation
Dual C
O fuck I took such a fat L on physics
I got away with a middling B on both world and Fulton on that final
Don't even remember y I slept so little
I mean I still got on A on most of my finals, but it was still rape cuz of my lack of sleep
So I just tossed rhetorical stuff and guess every rhetorical device on the test
I literally didn't have enough time to study everything on the Fulton final
3 hours of sleep for 4 days
Finals week was an L for me tho
Fulton final wasn't that bad
China #1
Elizabeth knew
Proctor was hung
@Kiran Suresh @Abhishek Koul @Graydon Perry @Nick Jiang
Cyber offensives
Is this
Literally just cuz of the vomit app layout I'm not gonna take the deal
And I don't want to lose my fingerprint sensor
Looks disgusting compared to my nice, spaced out layout
IPhone app layout would piss me off
Unlike the fucking vomit app layout on ios
I like having my screen nicely managed
Now that I think of it
Actually
Wait
I don't use my phone for much except watch yt and this one game so I don't think I'll care too much
And the 11 has a great camera
I got this phone for the camera more than anything
Tho come to think of it, would it be that bad to use an iPhone
Cuz I just turn off my brain for an hour or two after dagen
I mean I just thought of it while being literally brain dead
It's not like this plan takes a genius to think of
I could've bought my gpu with that extra money
Damn
Rip its a lease
Might as well
AT&T is kinda shitty
I'm fine with staying with sprint
Hopefully not
And I'd profit around 300
And buy another pixel 3
Sell that iPhone 11
Is turn in my pixel 3
So what I might do
Apparently sprint has this deal that u can turn in a phone for an iPhone 11 if switch to their plan
I said yes to the fact that ur capping
Annotate the article she passed 9ut
Yes
Find his keys quote
Proctor
I don't remember parris saying kids were bad
Something along those lines
Proctor says the children dangle the keys to the kingdom
Ima flex on u tmr with my cramped paragraphs
Imagine not having absolutely stacked annotations
Gotem
Ur mum
What a loser
Imagine sleeping
Before this Playlist only has songs that slap
I wonder how many more songs there r in here to purge
Spooky
Spotify legit finding the songs I listened to while in the car in sixth grade
The average age of my Playlist prolly shot up by a few years tho
Bruh these songs Spotify recommended me all slap
Lmao
Wtf r u trying to do
He was like
I tried it on Brian
Ye lmao
Like I didn't know I knew the Japanese word for library
Lmao
Wait I actually might know a good few Japanese words I don't know about cuz they just copped some Chinese
Lmao
I don't know anything at all in Cantonese
Cuz ik like 10 Japanese words
I understand more Japanese than I do Cantonese
I've got three instrumental ones
Except for this one Russian propoganda song
The rest r Japanese
Lmao
I've got at least 100 Chinese songs
Yes
And 2 of them r sung by Asian ppl
Lmao
Now I've got 3 English songs left out of the original 20 or so when I made a Playlist for the first time
Which is y I felt the need to purge in the first place
I did that last week
So I went and purged them
Some of the songs weren't as good
I shortened to 122
Cuz I had 139 songs
I was gonna start at 6 yesterday but xcom came along
I started at 8
Don't worry about it
First period tmr
I tried to purge my Spotify Playlist but I only found like 15 songs I didn't enjoy as much
This psych outline feels long
She expects a book
So she prolly expects one page double spaced
It just says paragraph or two
This is a problem I have sometimes too
Lmao
I actually don't know for that one
It was in Salem I'm pretty sure
...
This xcom 2 expansion slaps
cIndia is cOwned by pChina
China clowns Pakistan
China's capable population
Chinese communist party
Ye
They kept trying to say stuxnet worked because it made Iran sign the nuclear agreement lmao
Iirc in final focus we only briefly addressed our own case cuz literally everything came down to us clapping stuxnet
So
But they ran stuxnet
They weren't bad debaters
I felt bad for them
We did
Ye
Rip
The Amador team ran with stuxnet as their main contention for aff
Lmao
Stuxnet strongest evidence
Stuxnet yeet
Oco's cause nuclear warfare
O icic
Just went on wills doc to cop it
I shared it with ur Gmail I think
Sssh
If u can get me gold bid and do all my prep for me
I sent it earlier
@Robert Gan can u read my paragraph real quick
I put two sticks together for most of my beams
Ye
Ye, u can use 2 max iirc
There's a max and min measurement on the paper
Then if it fits it should be fine
Like using three together instead of one or two
U didn't do like triple sticks or anything right
If it fits within the parameters it's fine
So u should be fine
The instructions r actually relatively simple
So if it's 3mm off u better sand that bitch down a little
That's what happened to this one dude last year even tho his bridge held 120 pounds or so
If it doesn't fit, u get a B
Cuz he has this mold he sticks the bridge into or something
You'll actually get fucked if it's like 1mm off
Make sure ur bridge is within the measurements
Wait
Finally found it
Very annoying
I can't find it
About creating a sea of tears and hangings ppl to uphold the law
That Danforth said his thing
Anyone remember where it was
And u can bet him
I'll sell @Will Liang to u for $5
Ez 40
Just make a bunch of triangles
I hit 41
It was an L
And just held it with glue
Accidentally snapped a leg on my bridge
No plan or anything
I just assembled my bridge last year
Lmao
Lmao
I told u I was specifically looking for propaganda
My article isn't just describing it
Wait prem
Lmao
This man
Which is not the same thing as accusing someone of being a witch
Trump supporters called it a witch hunt
They aren't puritans
No one called anyone a witch
What
Aight bet
Everything else I can remember has been formal
I can only remember the ad one being informal
I don't think so
I'm gonna go with that
Which I assume means it should be allowed to be informal
And it says discussion in there
I think she said it was informal
Only wrote the precis
Cuz then I can just pop off and not worry about anything
I really hope it's informal
But my memory could be lying
I remember getting a huge grin cuz she said it was informal
Idk tho
Iirc they weren't but I'm not sure
Anyone remember whether the paragraphs r formal or not?
You removed a message
I said
Me too
5/10
The movie looked great tho
But then he came back
When Olaf died I was glad
Bruh I just watched frozen 2
That's cap
The dprk is the perfect democracy
Don't u agree
@Will Liang
Best democratic process ever
That's a true democracy
Like that one country who hit 120% voter turnout
The higher the voter turnout, the better
Means best, free voting
No fear of repercussions from voting
Cuz then you've got no fear of interference
True democracy is where ur vote doesn't matter
I approve
Sounds very democratic
The most democratic nation in the world
Unlike the residents of the dprk
Cuz I can't even choose which retard I want
Can't relate
Haha
Imagine voting in retards
Can't rel- oh wait fuck
Haha
Imagine having a literal idiot as ur president
It's a legit tweet
U can find it
I ain't capping
Man actually sent this tweet, no cap
I found chenny at kumon
Very satisfying when the little fuck stopped dripping
Took me an hour
I was trying to fix a leakage issue after I cleared it
Im so fucking dead but that felt good
Just spent two hours taking apart, clearing out, and putting together my pipes under the kitchen sink
Holy fuck
And record that
We can just have a vc
Ay
Ur gonna have to be hanged
That is witchcraft
I'm sorry
Will
Cutoff for B+ was 87.5 right?
That was the last time I had an A at least
Iirc
93?
Idk
O

U were, before I showed u what I had

Everyone else is focusing on witchhunts
Lol

This poll is no longer available.

@Will Liangwhat was the most important domesticated animal
richard lionheart
right
just the caliphate
not of egypt iirc
saladin?
o
which one u talking about
what was the most important domesticated animal
lmao
i just learned that through a quizlet an hour back, the tenure one
what was the most important domesticated animal
who was the ottoman emperor who took constantinople
1+1
wasnt ineffective
no it just pissed the north off
which is y they threw shit
the courts forced them into it
which was y the north got so pissed
wait no it was enforced
Ye
Save urself
Fuck Salem and fuck the law
He just went
At the end he's definitely 5
Ye
3-5 maybe
It's one of my 5 free periods
That's the main reason y I like the class
I don't
Ancient history is so much more interesting
Ap world is just apush but better
Bruh no cap apush is hella boring
I actually went through a quiz let this time
Imagine studying for apush
Yes to all of the above



The answer is yes
Yes
What else could the subject be
Whatever the essay prompt is talking about
What tf do u think
U clown

Connect it to something outside of the subject
Basically our old pk point
The unicorn point is complex understanding
I learned this from some quizlet
It wasn't
That was sarcasm
Yes British people lived in the south
British ppl used success of the union to get more voting rights
British *
That's a unicorn point right there
Talk about how it got births ppl more voting rights
Civil War
For this one
Big whoop
Mania
He knew he was gonna die and went crazy for a bit
So mix of 2 and 3 I guess
And then tried to adhere more
So he felt bad
Stage 3
The church thing made him seem like a Chad, so it's good for him
The reason y he felt guilty for fucking her is cuz he failed to adhere
Wanted to keep his name clean
He knew he'd be an asshole for exposing everyone
I'd argue the ending is a solid 3 as well
And thus he followed both
And the values that everyone around him adhered to
He cared most about what others thought of him
Proctor seems to be solidly 3 I'd say
Or maybe it was someone else
Iirc
Part of it matches to a Carlin skit
I was just glancing over it
I know this part of stGe 6
O
Right
Sounds like a 4
But abrahamic God
I guess there's the old jade emperor, but I don't think he counts either
I mean there's the Buddha, but man's not God
I never grew up knowing about any other God than that one
So abrahamic God
Well I didn't know that
Little g refers to the rest
Capitalized God refers to abrahamic one
Like 90%
If u capitalize it it can only mean one I'm pretty sure
The jewish/christian/Muslim God
So that's the one God
I mean I capitalized it
Sounds like a 4 move to me
He creates a set of universal laws that he believes everyone should live by and conform to no matter what
Wait would u say God is 4
God is undefined
Ur sped
6 is messiah
6
No
2 sounds like the move
2 maybe
Actually
1 I guess
Where tf would u even put Abigail
And that everything should be done to uphold the law
His belief was literally that the law is absolute
Ye
Hit 4.5 for a little then ended at 5
I think hale was pretty stage 4 for most of it
I mainly just made comments and connections to normal life
None of it is too useful cuz the text isn't that hard to read now
Lmao
O I never looked at my annotations after I wrote them
With all my annotations and stuff
Aye I found my old kohlberg paper
I feel so fylfilled
This is some good fucking bread
?
Fucc
But in between it spoiled the whole thing for me
I read the blurb cuz it said children in it and listed them
And a Wikipedia article popped up
John proctor son
So I searched up
I wanted to find the name of John's children
When I was writing my dialogue
Yesterday afternoon
Bruh
G for God has forsaken me
Take that as u will
I'm hoping for that D
ima do it in psych and apush, im too tired to copy my hw
hmm
or just do it in psych and apush
should i stay up a bit to do math
ugh
i have math hw due tmr
cuz proctor just an alpha male
i just had him go first name
Brown is closer to 5/5
He's blackface
Ay that's what I was thinking
Men and women r equal and can do the same jobs
This is 2019
Well do the same thing but give one of them a strap on
And girls can work balls and mouth
Fuck the ass of the other dude
Have one guy fuck ur ass
Get a male and female pair
Yall forgot the asshole
Yall forgot a central part of the equation
Everyone
Hold up
Wait
Who knows
Maybe some ppl r into eye stuff
How about one on each ear
Das kinda crowded down there
I have a restraining order
No
Whitened it out?
What's the past tense of whiteout
What the
Books 3-8
Damn these ppl lead some pretty bleak feeling lives

Hw is 3-8 right
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
The other 3 can't possibly say I'm diligent or good at teamwork or anything
Cuz at least 2 of my teachers would have nothing but bad things to say about me
I'm physically trapped into asking Fulton and dagen for my letters of rec
A thought just came to me today
Very offensive
That is an ageist slur young man
Yeah @Abhishek Koul u clown
http://www.self.gutenberg.org/articles/eng/The_Crucible
There's prolly a Gutenberg for it
Find it online
This weekend is never going to be over because time is relative
I'm not gonna do any hw just cuz weekend in over
So
U clowns
There's no school tmr lmao
Bruh
Rip
While Fulton is more blunt
I think it may be more that dagen is nicer
95/100
"this essay is written poorly and this idea needs more development"
Meanwhile in Fulton
Cuz God judged it to be uncooth
I am beautiful
Mmm yes
Ray set her own nickname to Killer Bean.
Beautiful
Very identifiable
I got a great pfp
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
Flat is Justice changed the group photo.
I can see it going up to 10-12 by the end of the year
6 times I've studied
So yeah
Cuz I used words that weren't on that bank...
Which was my downfall
I knew all the words already
I've unironocally put the most effort into bio in terms of tests
Ye
Only vocab now that I think about it
One dagen thing
Wait
Compsci
The two dagen stuff
First psych
First apush
Lmao
That was one of the six times I've studied this year
Yeah
The most work I actually did was cram that one time
I was watching anime in class today
Wat
Me?
...
If he has a lower grade than me that'd be a rip
Or is it still high A
Isn't his grade kinda low
Gg
Only 4 points tho so they good
Rip
Welo
I heard something about forgetting public class
Ye
What'd he do
He got a 1 didn't he
Rip sean
Ye
Lez go
Lmao
And he's Sean
Even Sean has a better shot than me
Lmao
That's obviously not true
For compsci
I only do it when ik I can do a better job than everyone else.
Lmao
Cuz in compsci I'm the incapable one
Not compsci
Just look at my apush groups
No one's ever complained about it
Unless if my group is capable, then I ask them to look over it before I just use my thing
Then I'd just turn in or use whatever I did
And just do my own thing
Is I let my group do whatever
Tho the way I usually do it
Then I'd tell them to stop
No cap if I had a group that actively dragged me down I'd do that
Should've been an ass and complained about ur group to the teacher
Rip
Is 100/0
My GPA is undefined
Mmm
Wasn't presented as such
:/
Bruh
Will u actually kinda being an ass
Big asshole move
That's an actual Bruh moment
R u really making fun of ppl for gpa
Bruh
Wait
Yeet
Smh
That second solution is so much more obvious
Indeed
Imagine not making ur tree reversive
Should've made it reversive in the first place
Disgusting
My brain is too massive for u
Which is proportional to ur pk
Unlike urs
So my pp is three times more massive than the sun too
My brain is indeed three times more massive than the sun
Ye
So now I actively suck braincells in, thus negative brain cells
Forming a braincell blackhole
Their mass collapsed in on itself
I had so many brain cells
Indeed
Because a brick wall wouldn't so clearly look bored
Talking to me about math competitions is worse than talking to a brick wall
Prem doesn't understand?
Lmao
How long has it been
Bruh
How'd u provoke aadithyaa again
Bruh
@Kiran Suresh
Sue for racism?
Discrimination against South Indians?
So she's prolly just gonna be annoyed tmr in class ngl
She would've made it due the next day otherwise
She said in class that she was giving us three days so that we can work it out
Cuz she made it three days to give us time to get it working
She's most likely not giving u any extensions
I don't think it is
Is it cuz maintenance?
In that case just accept defeat and commit not breathe
Inb4 doesn't work
"early morning"
Inb4 shuts it off at 12am
Most likely just some time first period tho
Either that or when she wakes up and remembers
Prolly
Not sure
She's shutting it off early morningn
She said it in class
Ye
Imagine having periods
Cuz she's shutting it early morning
Wake up early then
Imagine not having access to time travel technology
Ez solution
Just invent time travel to finish it
Cuz a non profit gotta keep making money
Cb wants yo money
Pay them an extra 100
Is mucus a natural lubricant
True or false
Hey
Like I'd do my bio in math despite being given time to do it in bio
And never in the class where I'm given time to do it
I legit do the work for my classes in other classes
Imagine not doing it in another class
Lmao
Lmao
Absolute goons
Safari #2 and 3
Das kinda a rip
Ppl out there still using lollipop
Damn
Android 5
6th most popular platform
Wait
She gave us 3 days because she was being lenient and reasonable...
Firefox 69
8th most popular web browser
Lmao
Like a damn chrome pleb
Imagine not getting ublock on mobile
Cb goons
Cuz college board was being gay on Firefox
Had to use fucking Microsoft edge
I got it to work randomly during math class today
There's always windows where it works
We had three days to get it working
Then they try again like an hour later
He called on me while I was doing my outline
I did the thesis writes in class today lmao
Lmao
Rip
For turnitin
Lippers still doesn't have 12 up?
Wait
Hmm
Cuz there's no way u can say "I prioritized other work so it wasn't my fault I couldn't get it done"
Bruh someone tell me he's cappin
Cuz u made a conscious choice to do it
For priotizing the wrong work
That's literally just ur fault
Ur fault then
Aadithyaa obviously didn't
Cuz she specifically said she gave us extra time to get it working over these three days
Or ur plea, I guess
She won't accept ur offer
I'm just saying
Was to give us time to get it working
Instead of the day after she announced it
The reason y she made it due today
I mean
Rip
I did it in math todayb
Rip
Rip
Lmao
Then she just made it due at lunch
I did it in math today lmao
What's going on
Wot
Until second sem ap week hit
Gibbons thought I was fairly industrious I think
Overcapacity of steel
It's overcap
Lmao
U say that too often
And I serve every time
And I can hold the ball for as long as I want
No but u don't get any bounces
And u don't get any bounces
If I get to throw the ball
Hey Kiran I'll play u
Aadithyaa don't worry, I won't think less of u for being physically unable to perform
So...
But he won
Hmm
Lmao
That just means ur worse
If he's ass
Will said u were dying
@Will Liang r u faster or slower than aadithyaa
It was the morning of the same day too
Ye
And he's faster than u
Lmao
I was faster than him even after I ran and sprinted like 9 miles
Somehow
But he's faster than u
Always goes outn
Lmao
I used to know a little tennis but now I can't even hit a ball correctly
Can't believe this goon is faster than u @Aadithyaa Sridharbaskari
Lmao
And try to keep up with him
Run with will
Aadithyaa
Gg
So it just goes away after a little
Anger isn't a natural thing for me unless if it's in short bursts
The best way for me to resolve my anger is to just sit and do something else
I always end up sleeping late after I run lmao
K on cures my depression
Ima just binge some fucking anime while eating
I've got a plan to combat my anger already
Besides
My running won't help me
Dude my neck already hurts
I'm dead rn man
And after work
Not at 8 30 lmao
Make me feel better
Will ima make u dissappear like the uighurs
And I had a big brain reply to #1 and I got shafted again
I had a big brain reply to Robert but she stopped me
That's what it felt like today
BRUH
Bruh
I actually don't know cuz I just started spacing out
Splish splash ur opinion is trash
Lmao
But I don't read it so
So I do have a script
I mean I laid out everything I wanted to say on my soc sem notes
That was almost big brain
Hawthorne juxtaposed hesters condition before and after adultery to create pity and warn against adultery
That was the closest I came to being big brain today
Right
My juxtaposition thing was almost big brain tho
Will
Rip
There r 3 other ppl there
Cuz yall goon asses just sat
Just the last girl
"if you've got a problem, just make them go away"

Imagine caring
Wanted to fucking talk
Really
Cuz I reallyb
But it's more that I couldn't speak for 1st question
Thx I guess
I just laughed at my richey essays lmao
Rip
No luck
I was trying to find an 8th grade essay
Never a good idea
Don't presume to know too much
Bruh
Cuz it was funny as shit
Cuz I wanna see how much I've improved and have a good laugh at what I used to be
God damn telepathy
That's not what I'm thinking
When I say
What I'm thinking
Did u really just try to tell me
Bruh
Wat
I just think they're trash compared to what I can do now
I don't regret my richey essays
And it just made me hurt
I was reading it to see how much I've changed
Reading my richey essay was worse than cock and ball torture
God
Incorrect grammar use
Choppy sentence structure
Analysis that's just plot summary
Sees richey essay
I see what I was getting at, reads well, not bad analysis
I read my Fulton essays
Actually disgusting
Bruh read ur freshmen essays
That's too much work for a teacher who isn't Fulton
They legit so trash
I don't want to talk about my 9th grade essays
Ugh
And
I took a look back at my 9th grade essays
Well she is forced to work at 9th grade level shit
Lmao
No
Prioritized the ones who never went but allowed everyone to get their points in
I liked Fulton socsem a lot more
Literally all the other questions gave me a chance to go big brain except for 4
But I couldn't go big brain at all
I mean I think my juxtaposition thing was almost close to big brain
Same man
But everyone got to make whatever point they wanted
She prioritized those who didn't speak
Fulton soc sems were great
Ye
Bring crucifictions back for them
Hope they get marked down for wasting time
Well that's their fault for being retarded I guess
U see my fucking point here
It's fine that she prioritized, but I have a problem with her saying I can't say anything when she allowed Robert and subha to go for 20 minutes
Yes exactly
For me to be pissed
How does it not make sense
And I could say fuck all up there
When it didn't apply to the previous two periods
But when u specifically tell me I can't fucking go because I was already up there
It's fine to priotize
That's what pisses me off
It's more the fact that she specifically said we weren't allowed to go
I'm down with that
And they got called
Aadithyaa u illeterate fuck
And kept it raised
Then they should've raised their fucking hands
Is that too much to fucking ask
I wanted to make a point and participate
Doesn't mean I can't make a point
Just because u didn't get called
...
I'm beyond pissed rn
You'd know y
If u could
Can u fuckin read
Great point
Thx for being so specific
Very carefully
Well it sure as fuck sounded that way to me
How u could possibly big brain a question that asks u to analyze text
Show me
Gimme some
Before u try to accuse me of being bad
Plz try to at least fucking read my point
For any insight
Doesn't allow
The fucking question
I said in the past 20 minutes
Anything at all
Did u read anything
You've got the mind of a fucking infant
I swear to God
Aadithyaa
I was so pissed at the end of class cuz I wanted to say my point so bad
And I still wasn't allowed to speak after that
For 20 fucking minutes
They went
Did u see Robert and subha
I spoke like 3 times
Bruh
I want to fucking say shit
Tho I believe she does
It's not a matter of need
I'm gonna eat an Armenian infant
If she doesn't let me raise my hand and speak
I'm just saying
Idk
I swear to God ima eat an Armenian child
If she doesn't let me speak for #3
No one was monopolizing anything
We literally formed an automatic order of speaking in our group
Dude I said like three fucking things
And that pissed me off to no end
But I physically couldn't
I want to participate on the fucking conversation
Cuz there was fuck all to say
It's that I didn't get to say shit
Bruh it's not just that I don't think I did well
Jesus
I'm actually so pissed off about what happened today
So fuck me I guess
But I didn't think I could do that
Which Robert did, and she liked that
Unless if u just ignore the question altogether
There is literally nothing else u can do but quote him
U can literally only quote Hawthorne
For 4
Cuz u can't have any fucking insight
My insights r good, but not for #4
Bruh that can't be it
U fucking idiot
My grade is gonna go down because I didn't say anything of substance
There goes my fucking grade
Triple fucc
So
But she just stopped it there
Then after Robert's reply I had something big brain to say
Where there was no way for me to go big brain
Literally got the single question
Cuz I'm happy to delve into the storytelling elements
Or even the ending one
Or the chillingworth one
The love/hate one
And I get #3
I hope she letz me go on panel again
V annoyed
Ugh
Cuz I had something big brain to say
Actually got shafted so hard
Fucking hell
Not even allowed to talk
And I wasn't allowed to go for #1
Felt like shit
But still
I mean dagen seemed interested in the quote I found
Was fucking quote him
All I could do
Y
Literally the worst question
The question that wasn't a fucking question
We got #4
No
I was so pissed, now I'm just annoyed
It felt that way
Kinda a disaster
Was my soc sem round
Aadithyaa
Wat
Gl
U got 5 periods to do it
Bruh
Lest it contaminate the other territories and provinces
Very nice place to keep the kpop and k drama stuff
Korea is zoo

Enemies?

Ah fuck that's some good potato
I don't think it was from anywhere
Actually
It wasn't from anime
I'm just big brained like that
See prem
You'll see tmr
Get rekt
Thus I was most twice as fast as u
So if u calculated it, that's an average 8.6 seconds per point
Within 3 minutes
But that's 7 different prompts that each feature around 3 points
I'm bigger brain
For all 7 questions
Actually more like 3
I came up with all my soc sem ideas in the span of like 5 minutes
Wdym I needed time to think
My brain is so big I'm prescient
I'm bigger brain because I was able to foretell the assignment and prepare accordingly
This is what it feels like to be industrious
Very neat
Used the same evidence and stuff
I just had to regurgitate my ideas
Since I already wrote it all in my soc sem
I did the opposite
Hehe
Imagine having not finished the soc sem
Lmao
That's a lot more than I do
Wait will do u study for apush
Bruh
Hush
H7su
Small brain
Smh
Imagine only getting 92

Cuz ur brown
It's too high iq for u
Wdym base?
Decimals r of Satan

V/II=II
God never meant for us to use decimals
Decimals r for terrorists
Very intuitive
X+X=XX
Real men measure in XI's
Ur a terrorist
If u use Arabic numerals
Over Arabic numbers
Imagine throwing a tantrum
Is a better name
For being a math cunt or some shit
Is that the girl u guys all hated
Haha
69
Indeed
No one would ever say that to him
Wait it's aadithyaa
That's what she said
I was there when it was made
X*5=x5
That ain't right
Nah
Therefor 4*40=440
5*x=5x
No it isn't
So 4*40=440
4*x=4x
4*40 is 440
Hey
Guess who didn't get 18nwrong on apush mc
Hey
Unlike ur Stat group
I say my group in apush is retarded, but they're intellegent
Lmao
For being actually brain dead
Slap then silly
...
That's how I roll in apush
Just tell ur group they're retarded and carry
Before the day after they're due
Imagine doing math hw
My reach is epic Bible College
Harvard is my safety school
Imagine not being able to run while watching anime
To work at itea
Imagine doing IT
Don't pretend u wouldn't have
If u were there u would've fallen too will
Lmao
Lmao
Not my fault if my opponents too duddy to see that immigrants don't cause all alcoholism
I can Gary guarantee 3 A+
Lmao
Cuz yall bad at debating my bs
The gay debates inflate my grade
Ima get that A+ in psych ez money
Same for psych iirc
For apush it's 98
Literally .3 from A+ rn
Apush a+ easy money for me now
A Plus for APush
Go for A+ apush
Hey will
Lmao
98 A+ sounds weird to me
It should be 97
Idk y it isn't 97
That's what apush is
I think prem got that second sem
I'd have an A+ in math if I did my hw
A+ in math will be hard cuz I can't get myself to put an effort into a class like that
Ez money
But that A+ in apush and psych
We all r
Lmao
I'll settle for anything on dagen
Except for dagen
Bruh I'm going for all A's this year
I just want something to show my dad and assert that I can manage my fucking time
But the three classes r dud classes lmao
But I didn't do it
I opened it
I didn't do the survey
Lmao
I'm just that godly
Ironically I did better second sem, when I started just skipping pe
And I made it
To be as lazy as possible
I put in the effort
Lmao
Welcome to the B+ in pe gang
Precalc lmao
Math is ez
Math
Psych
Apush
Gonna clap this year
Ima start grinding to get 3 A+s
Cs is one of the classes where I only want a normal A
I do dagen stuff in sos too

Anime better than k dramas
Or I watch anime
I was looking at weird shit on reddit
Exactly
I use my own laptop
Hehe

Neat

96.4
Lemme check
O
Imagine studying for apush
95.5 lmao
@Will Liang  do u study for dbq
Studying for dbq
Wait who does that
I study for dbqs
Bold of u to assume
Ha
O she gives us the sources in class?
Wait in class?
That sounds very fun
O
Or what?
Like the stuff we wrote in Fulton?
And that means
What does she mean by argumentative
She did say it's argumentative
Wait
Maybe paragraph analysis or something
But I'd say one is a safer bet
Maybe two
Ye
Ja
U do that regardless
Especially teacher
Is too big a burden on both student and teacher
But two essays in one week
Makes sense
Maybe three
In two weeks or so
She's prolly gonna give us that essay on something else
Dagen can't either
Even Fulton couldn't do that shit
Imo
Cuz she can't feasably grade two essays at once
I doubt she's giving us another one
After reviewing bio and after my psych outline
I should finish the book tonight
Without revealing ur deepest secret
U can tell someone secrets
Bruh
Random dark stuff or some shit
So that means his plan was a dud
Dimmesdale never confessed to him tho, at that point
I hope not
We don't know
Will u dud
Lmao
That's literally his plan
...
Get very Close to him and learn all his secrets to do something, prolly
Can't grasp something that's nonexistent
It'd still be 0
Nah
I didn't do the health thing anyways
Bruh
Been there, done that
Due tmr
Do it again, twice
Annotate the trial
Imagine doing apush outlines more than one day before their due date
Lmao
You'll be as surprised as mussolini was
Read the whole thing
But Ethan
So Das cool
But the judge is apparently a great guy irl
It's a fake article
Ye
The judge is apparently a really good dude
Lmao
O it was a fake article to begin with
Gotem
But he turned out to be an ass so whatever
Prolly should've told him I had someone else ready to buy it
That was some other dude
Pretty good deal

She never told us
The worksheet
Is the thing due tmr
Wiat
I legit forgot that was our contention most of the time
O hey that's right
Isn't there a card or block about how solar panels r bad for the environment
Might as well just say carbon is better and say it could lead to renewables
Renewables is kinda rart
I'm split either way so I'm fine
So I'm not sure on that count
But then again someone could say how it's mostly in Africa
I feel like we should be fine as long as we don't spend too much time over it
Ffs
Could've at least told me something tho
All in good time I guess
At least tell me what we were gonna put in it so I can rewrite it
We gotta work on our neg case
Graydon u goon
To introduce the communist manifesto
It is time
These kindergarteners r arguing over private property
Ah shit
And putting in an effort
Imagine paying attention to details in apush
I am indeed speed
Can't remember what it said
It did
And I've forgotten already
I just finished the outline
What did the apush book say
Took a moment to register
Holy
Should I keep doing my apush outline now
Confirmation that age is now just a number
Oh wait I was thinking of Koreans and Chinese ppl
So the hindu doesn't eat it
Yeet
6th period doesn't have to do it yet
Can never be too sure
No one expects the Spanish inquisition
I relate

Omai

I play the Uno reverse card
There is no u
February 30th

I think I left the other chat after Alex got there
Cool
O
Wot be this
Waste
Not gonna waste my money on them unless my dad makes me do it
I'm safe
None of the colleges I want to go to need more than one rec letters
Ye
Uiuc straight up doesn't accept any lmao
Ucla doesn't need them
Let's see what ucla asks
Two is optional
Lez go
Berkeley only needs one letter of rec
Lmao
Change it to something about mitochondria
And just turn in that one for Marty too
Then change the words to ap bio
To have Fulton write me letter of rec
Bruh I have a high iq plan
And that
Cuz I'm usually on task in that class now
Marty is a legit possibility
Hey
Actually yeah I'd say four
Maybe four
I have three viable choices for my letter of rec
U can't say I'm much better there
U see what I do in apush
I mean
I'm literally the opposite of proactivity
I always turn in my math hw a day or two late
Ha
Proactive
Me
Then did nothing until yesterday
I annotated the first page on Monday
But then changing ur mind
And annotating it
Finding an article
Imagine being will
The annotating took me a little cuz of the article I chose
The paragraph will take me around an hour I think
You'll be fine I think
Gonna watch a little bit more anime and then get down to work
Doesn't seem like I'll be running
Welp my left foot is being a bitch
Lmao
Yesterday I was struggling to remember the word undercutn
Prolly cuz I'm listening to more Japanese and Chinese than I am English
My English has deteriorated over break for some reason
Cuz that article pissed me off
Cuz I called the author a bitch twice in my annotations
Is for use of language
The only reason y I can see I'd get docked off
Feeling good about this assignment
I went and found a propaganda piece on Hong Kong
I'll share mine with u later
Unless if my legs crap out or something, ima run for a bit
Can't look at it rn
Ye just received
ry8990@pleasantonusd.net
Hmm
That fits half the bill
I thought most ppl would do a Trump witch hunt thing
I still gotta write my paragraph instead of watching fate
What did u go with?
I wanna just know how many ppl did witchhunts
Did u do witchhunts?
O shit r we building another sharing circuit here
Aight

Solo?
Hmm
